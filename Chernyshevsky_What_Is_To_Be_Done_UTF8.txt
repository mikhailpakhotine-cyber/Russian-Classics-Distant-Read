PREFACE.

In the present translation the American public has an
opportunity of studying what the paternal Russian government regards as revolutionary literature. In the Russian
cities it is possible, by offering guarantees, by depositing
fifteen or twenty rubles, and by paying fifteen or twenty
kopeks a day, to borrow Tchernuishevsky's novel from the
libraries. It is dangerous property, however, and the person caught with it in his possession may make unpleasant
acquaintance with the police. It was published first in the
columns of the " Sovremennik " (Contemporary) . It was
written with all the enthusiasm which an ardent soul could

feel at the first breath of liberty blowing on a land long
ground down under the heel of oppression. It made an
immense sensation throughout Russia. It is said that hundreds of young girls living in disagreeable circumstances
started to follow Viéra Pavlovna's example, and hundreds
of young men, to live honorable, lofty, philosophical lives in
the fashion of the types represented by Lopukhóf and Kirsánof. The tendency of the story was quite too liberal, and
it was hardly brought out in book form before it was ruthlessly suppressed. Even now, however, it works like a
leaven ; and though it is dead, it lives. It is not a novel in
the strict sense of the word.

The characters are all drawn

from life : Kirsánof is understood to be a picture of the
distinguished Professor Shévitch of St. Petersburg, and
Viéra Pavlovna still lives. The extraordinary man, so singularly introduced in the third part, is regarded in Russia as
an ideal picture of the famous Karakózof.


======================================================================

PREFACE .

In the present unsettled state of the labor question this
novel of the crushed Russian reformer has a most vital

interest.

It ought to come to every poor working girl like a

breath from heaven, like an inspiration.

There is no reason

why Viéra Pavlovna's industrial experiment, which is no
chimerical dream, should not be put into practice in every
town where the English language is spoken. Are not the
signs as certain as fate, that co-operation is to be the great
system of the future ? and how reasonably it is presented in
" A Vital Question " !

Then there will be no more strikes

for eight hours of work, no more quarrels between employers
and the employed, for the employed will be themselves their
own employers. As regards the still more vital question
upon which the book touches, it is evident what the author
teaches , and with what a master hand ! The present marriage

system is in many instances a failure ; witness the proportion of divorces to marriages in every state, not only in this
country, but in countries where divorce is allowed, and the
immorality everywhere . How is it to be stopped ? not by
free love; but by education and the joining of those who were
meant to be joined. Marriage is a fact, and how is it to be
purified and made sacred ? Tchernuishevsky offers his
theory of its practical solution, not in the philosophically
absurd and weak conduct of Lopukhóf, which, perhaps , was
unavoidable in a country like Russia, but in the suggestions
of Rakhmétof, which, however, are only to be realized when
people have attained a higher state of morality and education than is to be found, except among a very few, in whom
the animal nature is absolutely tamed. Cases have been
known where man and wife, growing apart by natural development, have again established love through what we
call Christian grace ; how many such cases are there ? It
takes a miracle to mix oil and water.

This is a question

which forces itself home to every man and woman, " What
is to be done about it? " Whatever may be thought about


======================================================================

PREFACE.

V

Tchernuishevsky's solution, whatever may be thought about
the morality of the business-agreement theory, whatever
may be thought of the conduct of Lopukhóf, there can be no
doubt of the intense moral purpose of the author; he may
be mistaken, but his virtue is Spartan ; it is as heroic as

though it were ideally Christian .
Such is the motive of the story. But even more important than this special motive is the general theory of the
equality of women, the development of which makes the
real greatness of the book.

Such an ideal of womanhood is

offered as can scarcely be found anywhere else in literature .
Even those who, possibly misunderstanding what Tchernuishevsky really proposes, think his ideas in respect to freedom of divorce unsound and immoral, cannot fail to recognize the magnificence of the prospect which he opens before
" the softer sex " in Viéra Pavlovna's Fourth Vision.

It

ought to be read and taken to heart by every woman in the
world.

It lies with the women themselves to determine their

treatment by men, and the terrible social state from which

now so many unfortunate creatures, both married and single,

are suffering, might be cured as malaria is cured by the
wind of the sea, if this theory were only brought into prac66

tice. " A Vital Question " should especially be grateful to
the women of this land, which is popularly supposed to be
" the land of freedom . "

A few words about the author himself may be interesting.
Nikolaï Gavrilovitch Tchernuishevsky¹ was born in 1829,
in the city of Sarátof. His father, a man of remarkable
intellect and character, was an archpriest of the cathedral ,
who was revered and loved by all who knew him. The
young Nikolaï was placed in the Theological School at

Sarátof, where he devoted himself with remarkable assiduity
to the study of the ancient languages , and particularly of
the Bible. At this time he was an unquestioning believer ;
1 It is also sometimes spelt Cerniscevski, in the Polish fashion.


======================================================================

PREFACE.

but as his mind developed, he found that the atmosphere of
the Greek Church suffocated him.

His old father made no

opposition, and sent him to the University of Petersburg,
where he entered the philological faculty, and devoted himself to the mastery of the ancient languages , and especially
the Slavonic. He was an indefatigable reader, and having
been introduced to the study of sociology, he locked himself
in his room, and read everything that he could find in Russian , French , and German on the subject, and the training
he had received in the seminary quickly enabled him to become a master of it. After his graduation in 1850 he was
engaged as instructor of literature in the School of Cadets ;

but at the end of a year, at the request of his mother, who
was very dear to him, he gave up the pleasant circle of

acquaintances, and the delightful life in Petersburg, and
became a teacher in the gymnasium of his native town. It

was a particularly trying position for a man of his liberal
views ; but he had the satisfaction of exerting an immense
influence in the circle in which he moved.

It is said that

through his silent example and personal popularity many of
the petty officials who hitherto had wasted their time and
energies became interested in self-culture, and, what was
more for Russian tchinovniks, refused to accept bribes.

Nikolaï met a young girl belonging to this circle, and fell in
love with her. His mother died in 1853, and shortly after,
with his father's blessing, he married, and moved to Petersburg, where he earned a precarious existence by various
literary work. Finding that English translations were becoming fashionable, he learned English in two months, and
translated a novel.

Meantime, he was working for his

degree of magister. His dissertation on " The Esthetic
Relation of Art to Reality" was so radical in its ideas that
it caused his rejection. He got into difficulty with the
director of the Corps of Cadets, and resigned his position as
teacher, and thenceforth devoted himself to literature. His

dissertation gave him a place in the office of the " Sovremennik " as critical and political writer.
After the accession of Alexander II. , while the Emperor
was still enjoying his prestige as " Tsar- Liberator," Tchernuishevsky , through the journal, energetically devoted himself to the instruction of the people, in the science of political
economy. That involved him in a controversy with the
conservative political economists of Russia. He was charged
with revolutionary sentiments. At first the government tried
to buy him off, by offering him the office of editor of certain
government publications. He accepted the position of editor
of the " Military Magazine," under certain conditions, but
he could not hold the position. From this time began a
systematic effort to ruin him. Anonymous articles and
pamphlets were attributed to him, and finally he was arrested ;
though nothing was really found against him, he was kept in
prison for two years. A spy was introduced into his cell ;
but the worst that he could be charged with was that he said,
" Now is the time, not to think, but to act."

But there were

rumors of a Polish insurrection, and of risings among the
serfs , and such a man was dangerous ; therefore he was tried

and condemned on forged documents. The reading of the
sentence took place on the morning of the twenty-fifth of
June, 1864, two years and two months after his incarceration. A great throng gathered, in spite of the rain, and just
as the sentence was finished and the sabre was broken, ac-

cording to the custom when a well-born person is condemned,
and while the executioner was fastening Tchernuishevsky's

hands to the rings on the scaffold,¹ a great bouquet fell at his
feet. Tchernuishevsky was sent to the mimes . At this time
there were upwards of three thousand people imprisoned in

Central Russia alone. Two years later occurred the attempt of
Karakózof on the Emperor's life.

It happened on the fourth

of April (O. S.) ; and by a singular coincidence Tchernuishevsky's novel was dated April 4, 1863. It was proposed to
bring him back to trial as an accomplice. This absurdity
was not carried out ; but after Tchernuishevsky had served
seven years , Count Shuválof, the head of the police, had him
excepted from the usual respite.

Afterwards he was sent to

Yakutsk, and imprisoned under the close guard of two gens
d'armes and two Cossacks. In the words of the historian,
" Thus Nikolaï Gavrilovitch Tchernuishevsky was cut off
from society and science."

The story of Tchernuishevsky's imprisonment is heartrending. Even before he was sentenced, he was allowed to
see his sick wife only after he had starved himself almost to
death, and even then only in the presence of others. Afterwards he was allowed to write her once a year ; but this privilege was taken away from him when some spies reported
that there was a plot to have him rescued. He was not
allowed to have books or writing material, and in sheer desperation he punctured a vein in his arm, and wrote in letters
of blood on the wall of his cell. It was not strange that his
mind- one of the brightest minds that Russia ever produced
was broken by such tortures. Tchernuishevsky, at last
accounts, was still living under police supervision in Astrakhan. A reporter of an English daily interviewed him a
year or two ago, and found him still intelligent, but a mental
wreck. Such action is worthy of the Austrian government
towards dangerous Silvio Pellicos ; but is it not incredible

that a country in the nineteenth century should employ such
means to deprive itself of a man who would have reflected
more glory on the realm of its emperors than the emperors
themselves ?

and it is hoped that it may be forgiven, even by that
school of critics which lays down the commandment, " Thou

been made, which it is right to mention, for the sake of
those who believe that a ready-made coat must be worn with-

out alteration, even if it does not fit. In one single scene
Kirsánof's character has been slightly mended, better to suit
the American ideal of man. A very few Russian words
have been retained, in cases where there was nothing corre-

sponding to them in English. Such are sufficiently explained
in the text. Tchernuishevsky's style is often exceedingly
awkward. He sometimes strove after originality, at the expense of wisdom ; but it cannot fail to be recognized that
" A Vital Question " deserves a high rank among modern
novels. Those who begin it will not be likely to lay it down
unfinished .

A VITAL QUESTION.
‫مم‬

I.
A FOOL .

On the morning of the 23d of July, 1856, the servants of
one of the largest hotels of Petersburg, near the Moscow
railroad station, were in perplexity, and even partly in fear.
On the previous evening, about nine o'clock, a gentleman
arrived with a valise, took a room, gave his passport to be
registered, asked for tea and a small cutlet, gave orders that
they should not disturb him during the evening, because he
was tired and wanted to sleep, but that they should wake

him without fail at eight o'clock in the morning, because he
had important business.

Then he locked the door ; and ,

after rattling his knife and fork, and jingling the tea-things
for a time, nothing more was heard of him.

He was appar-

ently asleep. Morning came ; at eight o'clock a servant
knocked at the stranger's door; the stranger did not
answer. The servant knocked louder, very loud ; still the
stranger did not reply. Apparently he was very tired. The
servant waited a quarter of an hour, again tried to arouse
him, again was unsuccessful. He consulted with the other
servants , with the butler.

" Can anything have happened to him ? "
" We must break in the door ."

" No, that won't do !
have a policeman . "

If we break in the door, we must

It was decided to try once more, still louder ; if it failed
this time, to send for the police .

They made their last endeavor ; they could not arouse him.
They sent for the police, and now they are waiting to see
what the result will be.

About ten o'clock a policeman came ; he himself knocked
at the door, ordered the servants to knock ; result the same
as before .


======================================================================

A VITAL QUESTION.

" There is nothing to be done; burst in the door, children."

They broke open the door. The room was empty.
" Look under the bed ! "

But there was no one under the bed.

The policeman

went to the table; on the table lay a sheet of paper, and
written in large letters were these words :
" I shall go away at eleven o'clock this evening, and I
shall not return.

You will hear of me on the Liteinaïa

bridge between two and three o'clock to-night.
be suspected."

Let no one

" Now I see, the matter is plain ; nobody could make anything out of it," said the policeman .

"What do you mean, Ivan Afanasyévitch? " asked the
butler.

" Give me some tea. I will tell you."
The policeman's narration long served as a subject for
lively discussions and arguments in the hotel. The story
was of this sort :

At half-past three last night, - the night was cloudy,
dark,
on the centre of the Liteinaïa bridge a fire
flashed, and the report of a pistol was heard.

The guards

rushed to the spot, a few people quickly collected ; not
a person or a thing was to be seen where the pistol shot
was fired . It was evidently not a murder, but a suicide.
Volunteers wanted to dive ; in a few moments boat-hooks

were brought, a fishing-net was brought ; they dived, they
grappled, they dragged the river ; they brought up about
fifty large chips, but they could neither catch nor discover

the body. Yes ; and how could it be found ? The night was
dark. In those two hours the body was already far down
towards the sea.

Go, find it there.

Therefore advanced

thinkers arose, discrediting the former supposition : " May be there was no corpse whatsoever. May be some
drunken man, or simply some mischievous fellow, played a
joke , fired off a pistol, and ran ; or perhaps the very fellow is
standing here among the excited crowd, yes, and laughing at
the trouble which he has made ."

But the majority, as is usual when a case is argued reasonably, proved to be conservative, and defended the former
supposition : " What kind of a joke is that ? Of course he put a bullet

into his brain, and that is the end of it ! " The progressive

party were outruled. But the victorious party, as usual,
having won the victory, was itself immediately divided.
" Let us suppose that he committed suicide. But what did he
do it for ? "

" He was drunk," was the opinion of some of the conservatives ; " a ruined spendthrift," asserted others .

" Only a fool " (durak) , said some one . And this expression, " Only a fool," was accepted by all, even by those who
discredited the fact of a suicide .

Indeed, whether it was a

drunkard or a spendthrift committed suicide, or whether
some mischievous fellow did not commit suicide at all, but

simply played a trick ; at all events, it was an absurd trick
of a fool .

And this put an end to the matter that night on the bridge.

In the morning, at the hotel of the Moscow railroad, it was
decided that the fool did not play a joke, but committed
suicide .

But there still remained, after all this story, an element in
regard to which even the vanquished party were in agrecment. It was this. If it was not a trick, but a case of suicide , nevertheless , it was a fool ! This conclusion, so satis-

factory to all parties, was particularly strong from the very
fact that the conservatives were victorious ; if he had only

played a trick by firing his pistol on the bridge, it would
have been really doubtful whether he were a fool or a mischievous fellow. But he shot himself on the bridge. Who
shot himself on the bridge ? How on the bridge ? Why on
the bridge ? Ridiculous to do it on the bridge ! and, therefore, he was doubtless a fool .
Again a doubt arose among some of them.

He shot him-

self on the bridge, but people don't go to a bridge to shoot
themselves ; consequently, he did not commit suicide.
Towards evening, however, the servants of the hotel were

summoned to the station to identify a cap, pierced with a
bullet hole, which had been taken out of the water ; all rec-

ognized that it was the very same cap that the stranger had
worn. Thus indubitably he must have shot himself, and the
spirit of denial and progress was entirely defeated.
All were agreed that it was a fool (durak) , and suddenly
all began to chatter, " On the bridge, a clever dodge ! It
was done evidently so as to save suffering ; for if the shot
did not kill, -he reasoned wisely, - no matter how slight
the wound was, he would jump into the water, and so drown

before he knew what had happened. Yes, on the bridge !
wisely done ! "
At this stage it was utterly impossible to come to any
decision ; both a fool and wise !
II.

THE FIRST CONSEQUENCES OF THE FOOL'S DEED .

On that very same morning, about twelve o'clock, a young
woman was sitting in one of the three rooms of a small
datcha on the Kamennoï Ostrof (Stone Island) ; she was
sewing, and singing in an undertone a little French song full
of spirit and courage. " We are poor," said the song, " but
we are working people ; we have strong hands. We are
obscure, but we are not dull, and we want light. Let us
learn ; knowledge will give us freedom. Let us be industrious ; industry will give us wealth. This will go on ; if we
live , we shall see it.
Ça ira,

Qui vivra verra.

We are rough, but from our roughness 'tis only we ourselves

who are the losers.

We are full of prejudices, but we our-

selves suffer from them ; this we feel.

Let us look for hap-

piness, let us find humanity, we shall be good ; this will go
on ; if we live , we shall see it .

" Industry without knowledge is fruitless ; our own happiness is impossible without the happiness of others .

As soon

as we become enlightened we shall become rich ; we shall be
happy ; we shall form one brotherhood and sisterhood ; this
will go on ; if we live, we shall see it.
" Let us learn and be industrious ; let us sing and love ;
we shall have a heaven on earth ! Let us be happy while we
live ; this will go on ; it will soon come to pass ; we shall all
see it.

Donc, vivons,
Ça bien vite ira,
Ça viendra,
Nous tous le verrons ! "

Courageous, spirited, was the song, and its melody was
joyous . There were two or three melancholy notes in it, but
they were concealed by the generally light character of the
motive ; they vanished in the refrain, they vanished in the


======================================================================

A VITAL QUESTION.

conclusion of the couplet,- at least they ought to have vanished and to have been concealed, and they would have vanished had the lady been in a different frame of mind ; but

now these few melancholy notes are made more prominent
than the others. She almost trembles as she perceives it ;
she lowers her voice as she sings them, and tries to sing the
joyful notes louder; but again her mind is drawn away from
her song by her own thoughts, and then again the melancholy
notes become prominent. Evidently the young woman does
not like to give in to melancholy, and it is no less evident
that the melancholy is loath to leave her, no matter how hard
she tries to drive it away. But whether melancholy or joyful,
whether or no it becomes joyful in the spirit of the song, the
young woman sews very industriously. She is a good
seamstress .

A young servant girl comes into the room.
" Do you see, Masha, how I am sewing ? I have almost
finished the cuffs which I am getting ready to wear at your
wedding ."
" Akh ! there is much less work in them than in those which

you made for me. "
" That's of no matter ! a bride ought to be dressed better

than anybody else at her own wedding."
" And I have brought you a letter, Viéra Pavlovna."
Viéra Pavlovna's face expressed perplexity, as she began to
break open the letter ; the envelope bore the city post-mark.
" How is this ? Isn't he in Moscow ? " She hastily unfolded
the letter and grew pale ; her hand holding the letter fell to
her side .

" No, it is not so ; I have scarcely had a chance to read

the letter ; there is nothing in it at all."
And again she lifted her hand with the letter. All this
took place in two seconds .

But at the second reading her

eyes looked long and immovably at the few lines of the letter ,
and the brightness of their expression grew dimmer and dimmer ; the sheet fell from her nerveless hands to the work-

table ; she hid her face in her hands ; she began to weep.
" What have I done ? What have I done ?" And again sobs.
*

*

" Viérotchka [Little Viéra] ! What is the matter with you ?
Are you so fond of weeping ? How often does this happen ?
What is the matter with you ? " - a young man came into the
room with quick but gentle, careful steps.


======================================================================

A VITAL QUESTION.

" Read it ; it is on the table." She was now no longer
weeping, but was sitting motionless, scarcely breathing.
The young man took the letter. He also grew pale, and
his hands trembled, and long he looked at the letter, short
though it was , not more than a score of words all told :
" I have disturbed your peace of mind. I leave these
scenes . Don't grieve ; I love you both so much that I am
very happy at my decision. Proshchaïte " ( Farewell) .
The young man stood long, rubbing his forehead ; then he
began to twirl his mustache ; then he looked at the sleeve of

his coat ; finally he collected his thoughts. He made a step
forward towards the young woman, who was still sitting
motionless, hardly breathing, as if in a lethargy. He took
her hand .
" Viérotchka ! "

But as his hand touched hers, she jumped up with a cry of
terror, as though she had been roused by an electric shock,
impetuously drew off from the young man, convulsively pushed
him from her .

" Go away ! Don't touch me ! You are stained with blood !

His blood is on you ! I cannot bear to see you ! I shall go
away from you ! I am going away ! Leave me ! " And she
kept pushing, pushing the empty air, motioning him away,
and suddenly she tottered, fell into the arm-chair, and covered her face with her hands .
" On me too is his blood ! On me ! Thou art not to blame !
I alone ! I alone ! What have I done ! " Her sobs choked
her .
‫دو‬

" Viérotchka," said he, gently and timidly, " my friend !
She drew a painful sigh, and with a restrained and still
trembling voice said, though it was hard to say :

He obeyed her silently. He went to his room, sat down
at his writing-table, where he had been sitting so calm, so
content, but a quarter of an hour before. He took his pen
again. " At such moments one should have perfect control
over himself. I have a will , and all will be well, will be

well." And his pen, without his control, all the time went
on writing some article or other. " Can it be borne ? It is
horrible ! Happiness is over ! "
" My love, I am ready. Let us talk," was heard from the

"Viérotchka ! why art thou to blame ? "
" Don't say a word, do not justify me, else I shall despise
thee ! I- I am to blame for all. Forgive me, my love, for
coming to a decision which will be very hard for thee, and for
me, my love, also ! But I cannot do otherwise ; thou thyself
wilt shortly see that it was best to do so. This is unalterable,
my friend ! Only listen : I shall leave Petersburg ; it will be
easier at a distance from the places which would remind me

of the past. I shall sell my things. On the money I get I
shall be able to live some time. Where ? In Tver, in Nizhni

[Novgorod] , I don't know ; it is all the same. I shall try to

give singing lessons. In all probability I shall find pupils ,
because I shall settle in some large city. If I don't find them,
I shall go out as governess. I think that I shall not come to
want ; but if I should, I will let you know. At any rate, be
sure to have some money ready for me. You know very well
that I have a good many necessities, heavy expenses, stingy
though I am; I cannot help it. Dost thou hear? I do not

refuse thy help. Let this be a proof to thee that thou art still
dear to me . And now let us part forever. Go back to town,

right away, right away ! It will be easier for me when I am
alone. To- morrow I shall not be here ; then come back. I
shall leave for Moscow. There I will see, I will find out in

which of the provincial cities I can easiest find singing pupils .
I forbid you coming to the station to see me off. Proshchaï,
my friend ! Give me thy hand in token of farewell ; I shall
press it for the last time. "

He wanted to kiss her ; she stopped his motion.
" No, it must not be ; it is impossible. This would be an
insult to him. Give me thy hand. I press it, thou seest how
warmly ! But forgive me."
He did not let go her hand .

" That is enough ! Go ! " She withdrew her hand. He did
not dare to resist.

" Forgive me ! "

She looked at him so

tenderly , and with firm steps she went to her room, and not
once did she look at him as she went.

It was long before he could find his hat. Though half a
dozen times he took it into his hand, he did not see that he

At last he realized

that what he was looking for was the hat in his hand.

went to the entry, put on his overcoat, and now he is near the

gate.

" Who is running after me ? Surely Masha. Surely

something bad has happened to her."

He turned around.

Viéra Pavlovna threw herself on his neck, embraced him,

kissed him passionately.

" No, I could not endure it, my love ! Farewell forever ! "
She hurried back, threw herself on the bed, and let the
tears flow which she had so long restrained.

which is told you. You don't know anything. You do not
even know that, by the way in which I began this story, I
insulted, I humiliated you. You did not know that, did you ?
Well, then, let me tell you !"
Yes , the first pages of this story show that I have a very

low opinion of the public. I have used the ordinary
shrewdness of novelists : I began my story with effective
scenes , clipt out from the middle or the end of it ; I covered

them with a fog .

Thou, O public, art clever, very clever,

and therefore thou hast neither discernment nor wit.

Thou

canst not depend upon thyself to tell by the first pages
whether the story is worth reading through. Thy sense of
smell is wretched; it needs aid, and there are two ways of
giving aid, - either the name of the author or effectiveness of

style.

I am going to relate to thee my first story.

hast not acquired a critical faculty, so as to judge whether
or no the author is endowed with an artistic talent (yet thou
hast so many writers, to whom thou hast attributed an artistic talent ! ) , but my name, has not yet attracted thee , and I
am compelled to throw a hook to thee, baited with an attraction of effectiveness . Condemn me not for it. Thou thyself art to blame ; thy simple-minded innocence compels me
to lower myself to such trivial business. But now thou art

caught in my hands, and I can prolong my story, according
to my own judgment, without any tricks. Henceforth there
shall be no mysteries ; thou shalt always be able to look forward twenty pages at a time and see the result of every situation, and now, at the very beginning, I will tell thee the
conclusion of my story: the thing will end joyfully, with
wine- cups , with song ; there will be no theatrical effects nor
embellishments. The author does not like embellishments ,

gentle public, because he always thinks what a chaos there is
in thy head ; how many, many needless sufferings are caused,
inflicted upon every man by the wild confusion of thy ideas .
It is to me both pitiful and ridiculous to look at thee ; thou

art so helpless and so piqued at the superabundant amount
of absurdities in thy head.
I am vext with thee because thou art so spiteful to people,
and yet thou thyself art the people. Why art thou so spiteful to thyself? That is the reason that I am scolding thee.

But thou art spiteful on account of thy mental helplessness ;
and therefore, while I am scolding thee, I am compelled to
help thee. What shall be the first step toward helping thee ?
By touching upon the very thing that now thou art thinking
about.

" What sort of an author is this who speaks so impu-

dently to me ? " I will tell thee what kind of an author I am.
I do not possess the slightest sign of an artistic talent.
My skill in using good language is small, but that is not of
the least consequence. Read ! my dear public ; not without
profit shalt thou read. Truth is a good thing ; truth compensates for the faults of that author who serves her. And
therefore I will tell thee, that if I had not warned thee ,

thou wouldst probably have the idea my story was written
artistically, that the author possessed a great poetic talent.
But I have warned thee that I have no talent, and thou

shalt now know that all the good qualities of this story lie
in its truthfulness .

In the first place, my kind public, as I am hitting thee

under the ribs, I must speak out to the end ; although thou
art fond of guessing, thou hast no skill to unriddle what has
been begun and now ended.

When I say that I have not a

sign of an artistic talent, and that my story has very little
style, don't make up thy mind that I am very much worse
than all thy novelists, whom thou callest great, and that my
novel is worse than theirs. I do not say that. I say that
my story has less style than the works of other people who
are endowed with talent. But, as far as merit goes, thou
canst boldly place my story in the same rank as the famous
writings of thy favorite authors ; thou wilt not be mistaken
if thou place it still higher. There is more art in it than in
theirs ; thou mayest rest assured of it.
Thank me now ; thou art obsequious to those who despise
thee : bow also to me .

But there is in thee, O public, a certain class of people
and at the present time a considerable number - whom I

esteem. To thee as a whole ; to the majority I am impertinent,
and it is only about the majority that I have been speaking.
As regards those whom I have just mentioned I should have
spoken humbly to them, even with some fear, but I had no
need of making explanations to them. I prize their opinions ,
but I know beforehand that they are on my side. The good
and the strong, the honest, the wise, ye have begun to arise

among us ; ye are not few in number, and ye are growing
more and more. If ye were the public, I should not have
to write any more ; if ye did not exist, it would be impossi-

ble for me to write. But ye are not yet the public, but ye
are a part of the public ; therefore, I must and I can write.

PART FIRST .
THE LIFE OF VIÉRA PAVLOVNA IN HER PARENTS'
FAMILY.

I.

VIÉRA PAVLOVNA's training was very ordinary.

Her life ,

up to the time when she made the acquaintance of the medi-

cal student Lopukhóf, was rather remarkable, although it
was not singular.

But in her actions even then could be

seen something singular.
Viéra Pavlovna grew up in a many-storied house on Gorokhovaïa Street, between Sadovia Street and the Semyonovsky
bridge. At the present day this house is marked with its appropriate number, but in 1852, when as yet the streets were
not numbered, it bore the inscription, " The house of the
Actual State Counsellor,¹ Iván Zakharuitch Storeshnikof. "
Such was the inscription ; but Ivan Zakharuitch Storeshni-

kof had died as long ago as 1837, and since that time the
proprietor (khozydin) of the house was his son Mikhaïl
Ivanovitch (thus said the documents) ; but the tenants knew
that Mikhail Ivanovitch was merely the son of his father,
and that the real proprietor was Anna Petrovna.

The house was at that time just as it is now, large, with
two gates and four entrances on the streets, and with three
yards (dvors ) in the rear. At the principal entrance on the
street, on the belétage, there were living in 1852, just the
same as at the present time (1860) , the khozydïka and her
son. Anna Petrovna is now, and she was then, a lady of
distinction. Mikhaïl Ivanovitch is now an army officer of
distinction, as he was then a distinguished and handsome
officer.

I do not know who is now living on the fourth floor apartment, on the right hand, as you enter from one of the innum-

erable dirty back entrances of the first dvor; but in 1852
there were living there the manager of the house, Pavel Konstantinuitch Rozalsky, a hardy and representative man, his

with that of general of the army.

A VITAL QUESTION.

wife Marya Alekséyevna, a lean, strong, tall woman, with
their daughter, a grown-up girl, the very same Viéra Pavlovna,
and their little nine-year-old son Feódor.

Pavel Konstantinuitch, beside having the management of
the house, held the office of assistant (stolonatchalnik) in a
government department. His office gave him no salary, but
at home he had a small income ; any one else would have had
much more, but Pavel Konstantinuitch, as he himself said,

had a conscience. Consequently the khozydïka of the house
was very well satisfied with him, and during the fourteen
years of his management he had accumulated a capital of about
ten thousand rubles. Of this money only three thousand, and
no more, came out of the khozyáïka's pocket ; the balance
was gained by being turned over and over, and not to the
detriment of the khozydika. Pavel Konstantinuitch was in
the habit of loaning money on pawn of personal property.
Marya Alekséyevna had also a little capital ; about five
thousand, as she told her kumashki (gossipy friends), but in
reality she had more. The foundation of this capital had
been laid about fifteen years before by the sale of a raccoonskin shuba, a little dress , and some furniture which had been

left Marya Alekséyevna by her brother, a tchinovnik. Having thus obtained about one hundred and fifty rubles, she also

began to turn them over and over by loaning on personal
security.

She took greater risks than her husband did, and

many times she got caught on the hooks. Some rogue borrowed five rubles from her on the security of a passport ;
the passport happened to be a stolen one, and it cost Marya
Alekséyevna about fifteen rubles more to free herself from
the entanglement. Another rascal pawned to her a gold
watch for twenty rubles ; the watch proved to have been
taken from a murdered man, and Marya Alekséyevna was
compelled to spend a good round sum to get out of this entanglement. But if she suffered losses which her husband

by his careful scrutiny of securities avoided, still her capital
grew with greater rapidity. Singular instances of her way
of money-getting were detected. Once upon a time - Viéra
Pavlovna was then small ; if her daughter had been older,
Marya Alekséyevna would not have done it, but at that time
"why not do it ? the child does not understand " ; and indeed,
Viérotchka by herself would not have understood it , but she
did learn of it, thanks to the cook, who explained it to her
with very great detail . Yes, and the cook would not have

spoken of it, because the child ought not to have known about
it; but it happened so that her soul was impatient after
Marya Alekséyevna had given her one of her tremendous
thrashings because she had taken a walk with her lover (by
the way, Matrióna's eye was always black and blue, - not because of Marya Alekséyevna's fist, but her lover's, - and this
had its good side, since a cook with discolored eyes does not
get such high wages). But as I started to say, once upon a
time, there came to Marya Alekséyevna a lady of her acquaintance whom she had not seen for a long time, well
dressed, magnificent, handsome ; she came and made quite a
visit. She staid quietly for a week, but all the time a certain

civilian came to see her, a handsome man, who gave Viérotchka candy, and presented her with beautiful dolls , and
gave her also two little books. Both had pictures, but in
one of the books were pretty little pictures , -animals and
cities , - but the other little book Marya Alekséyevna took

away from Viérotchka after the gentleman had left ; so
that she saw the pictures only once , and that was while he
was there ; he himself showed them to her. About a week

this lady stayed with them, and everything was quiet in the
house. Marya Alekséyevna all the week did not once go to
the cupboard (where a decanter of vodka was standing) , the
key of which she always kept in her own possesion. Shedid
not beat Matrióna, did not beat Viérotchka, and she did not
scold as loud as usual; then one night Viérotchka was constantly disturbed by their guest's terrible shrieks, by the
going and coming, and the uproar in the house. In the
morning Marya Alekséyevna went to the cupboard and stood
in front of it longer than usual, and kept saying, " Glory
to God ! all went well, glory to God ! " She even called
Matrióna to the cupboard, and said :

" To your health, Matriónushka, you too worked hard ! "
But instead of doubling her fist as she used to do in old times ,
after visiting the cupboard, she kissed Viérotchka and took
a nap. After this the house was quiet for about a week,
and the guest did not shriek any more, but she never left the
room until she went away altogether. Two days after she
left , a civilian came, not the one who had been there before ,

but another civilian, who brought with him the police, and
gave Marya Alekséyevna a round berating, but Marya Aleksévevna did not yield to him, but kept asseverating : -

" I know nothing whatsoever of your business.

You can

find out by the register who has been staying with me. Mrs.
Savastyánova, the wife of a merchant of Pskof, and a friend
of mine has been here , and that's all there is of it."

Finally, after using his whole battery of words, the civilian departed, and never appeared again. Viérotchka witnessed this when she was eight years old, and when she was
nine years old, Matrióna explained to her what the occurrence really was. However, such an occurrence happened
only once ; there were various others , but nothing like this.
When Viérotchka was a little girl of ten years old, as she
was going one day with her mother to the Tolkutchy (Pushing)
Market, and was turning from Gorokhovaïa (Bean) Street to
Sadovaïa (Garden) Street, she received an unexpected slap
on the head, with the words : " What are you looking at the
church for, you fool, without crossing yourself? What ! don't
you see that all good people make the sign of the cross ? "
When Viérotchka was twelve years old she began to go to
school, and a piano-teacher came to give her lessons, a German who was a drunkard, but was otherwise a very good
man and an excellent musician. Owing to his habits his
terms were very low .
When she was fourteen years old she used to sew for the

whole family ; the family, however, was not large.
When Viérotchka was going on to her sixteenth year, her
mother began to scold her in this way : " Wash your face,
'tis like a gypsy's. You could not get it clean, if you tried ;
you're such a scarecrow. I'd like to know whose child you
are, anyhow . "

She was always ridiculed on account of the tawny complexion of her face, and she got accustomed to look upon

herself as extremely ugly. Hitherto her mother had dressed
her almost in rags, but now she began to give her fine

clothes. And Viérotchka used to go to church in her fine
clothes with her mother, and say to herself : " These fine
clothes would suit somebody else ; but no matter how I'm

dressed, I'm always a gypsy, a scarecrow . I might as
well be in calico as in silk, but it is good to be pretty. How
I should like to be pretty ! "

When Viérotchka had completed her sixteenth year she
stopped taking piano lessons, and no longer went to school,
but began to teach in the very same school : afterwards her
mother got other teaching for her.
At the end of six months her mother ceased calling her

gypsy and scarecrow, and dressed her even more elegantly
than before , and Matrióna - this was the third Matrióna
since the one whose eye had been black and blue, but she

had oftentimes a scratched cheek, but not always - Matrióna told Viérotchka that her father's nutchalnik was going to
pay her his addresses, and that still another natchalnik of
great importance, with an order around his neck, had the
same intention.

And in fact the little tchinovniks of the

department gossipped among themselves that the natchalnik

of Pavel Konstantinuitch's office was getting very affable to
to the latter, and the office natchalnik began to confide to
his cronies that he must have a beautiful wife even though

she had no dowry, and he would add that Pavel Konstantinuitch was an excellent tchinovnik.

How this would have ended cannot be conjectured, but the

natchalnik of the office deliberated a long time, and while
he was taking his own time, another opportunity arose.
The khozydïka's son came to the manager to say that his
mátushka wanted Pavel Konstantinuitch to get specimens of
wall-papers , because she was going to re-paper the rooms in
which she was living. Hitherto all such orders had been
given through the janitor. Certainly such a case as this
could be comprehended even by people who were not as
shrewd as Marya Alekséyevna and her husband. The landlady's son sat for more than half an hour and did them the
honor of drinking tea with them. It was flower tea. Marya
Alekséyevna on the very next day gave her daughter a necklace which had been taken as a pledge and had never been

redeemed, and ordered for her daughter two new and very
fine dresses ; one of a material costing forty rubles, and the
other fifty-two. With ruchings and ribbands, and everything
in style, these two garments cost one hundred and seventyfour rubles, at least so Marya Alekséyevna said to her husband ; but Viérotchka knew that the real cost was less than

one hundred rubles, for the purchases were made in her
presence, and for one hundred rubles two very fine dresses

could be made. Viérotchka was delighted with the dresses,
was delighted with the necklace, and was still more delighted
because her mother at last consented to buy her shoes for
her at Korolyef's, because the shoes that one gets at the

" Pushing Market " are shapeless, while those sold by Korolyef fit the feet so beautifully.

The dresses were not bought in vain ; the khozyáïka's son

got into the habit of coming to the manager's rooms, and
naturally used to talk with the daughter more than with the
manager or the manager's wife, and naturally enough they

gave him every opportunity. Nu ! the mother gave her
daughter plenty of advice which need not be repeated, as its
tenor can be easily imagined.
One day after dinner the mother said : " Viérotchka, put
on your dress , your best dress. I have got up a surprise for
you : we are going to the opera. I have got tickets for the
second tier, where all the generals' wives go. This is all for

your sake, little goose , [dúrotchka] ! This is the last money
that I am going to waste on you. Your father has spent so
much on you that it has gone to his stomach ! How much
did it cost to send you to school and to give you piano lessons ? You don't appreciate it in the least, you ungrateful

hussy ; no, you haven't any soul in you, you unfeeling
minx ! " That was all that Marya Alekséyevna said. She
no longer scolded her daughter, and that could scarcely be
called a scolding. Marya Alekséyevna now only spoke to
Viérotchka, and had never really scolded her or beaten her
since the rumor about the office natchalnik had been spread
abroad.

They wentto the opera. After the first act the khozydika's
son came into their box with two of his friends ; one was a

civilian, thin and rather elegant ; the other was an army
man, fat, and freer from affectation. They took seats and
sat down, and they whispered among themselves for a time ;
the khozyáïka's son and the civilian said a good deal, the
officer said less. Marya Alekséyevna tried to listen, and,
though she distinguished almost every word, she understood
very little, because they spoke in French. She caught some
half a dozen words in their conversation , - belle , charmante,
amour, bonheur. But what good was it to know so few

words,- belle, charmante ? Marya Alekséyevna knew long
ago that her gypsy was belle and charmante. Amour -Marya
Alekséyevna could see that he was over head and ears in
love ; and when there is amour, of course there must be

bonheur. What good did these words do ? The main question is, will he offer himself before long?
" Viérotchka, you ungrateful thing ! " whispers Marya
Alekséyevna to her daughter ; " why do you turn your head
away from them ? Do you feel offended because they came

in? They do you honor, you fool [dura] ! What is the

Viérotchka told her.

" No, I did not hear any such words. Viéra, are you
sure that you told me right ? You be careful ! "
" No , no ! You will never hear any such words from
them. Let us go home. I cannot remain here any longer."
" What's that you say, you nasty thing ? " Marya Alekséyevna's eyes grew bloodshot.
" Let us go home. Do with me as you please afterwards,
but I will not stay here. I will tell you why when we go.
Mámenka," - this word was said loud enough for all to hear
-

" I have a very bad headache. I cannot remain here. I

beg of you ! "
Viérotchka stood up.
The young men were confused.

" It will pass away, Viérotchka," said Marya Alekséyevna,
sternly but decorously.

" Just take a walk through the

corridor with Mikhail Ivanuitch, and your headache will go
off."

" No, it will not go off ; I feel very bad ; quick, mámenka ! "
The gentlemen opened the door ; each wanted to offer

Viérotchka his arm, but the detestable young girl refused.
They handed the ladies the cloaks ; they escorted them down
to the carriage. Marya Alekséyevna looked haughtily at the
waiters . " Look you , serfs ! what cavaliers these are ; and
this one here is going to be my son-in-law. I myself will
have such serfs. And you put on airs, put on airs if you

dare, you nasty thing, you ! I will put them on for you ! "
But wait, wait ; the son-in-law is saying something to her

ugly but proud little girl, while he is putting her into the
carriage. " Santé, that must mean health ; savoir, that's
' I know' ; visite, the same as in Russian ; permettez, ' I beg
your pardon.' ”

Marya Alekséyevna's anger was not less diminished by
these words , but she had to take them into consideration .

The carriage drove away.
" What did he say to you when he put you in ? "
" He said that he would call to-morrow morning to learn
about my health . "

" Ain't you lying? do you mean to-morrow ? "
Viérotchka was silent.

" You are a lucky girl." Marya Alekséyevna could not

resist pulling her daughter's hair, only once, and not violently.

" Nu ! I will not lay my finger on you if you will only
behave to-morrow. Sleep to-night, you fool ! Don't you
dare to weep ! Look out, if I see to-morrow morning that
you are pale, or that your eyes are red with crying. I have

let things go so far ; I shall not stand it any longer. I shall
not take pity on your pretty little face. If you lose this
chance, I will teach you how to act."
" I ceased to weep long, long ago ; you know it. "
" That is all right [to-to-zhe] ; but try to be a little more
sociable with him."

" Yes , I will speak with him to-morrow."

" That's all right [to-to] ; it's time you came to your senses .
Fear God, and have pity on your mother, you shameless
thing ! "
Ten minutes passed.

" Viérotchka, don't be angry with me. I scold you because I love you ; I want to be good to you. You have no
idea how dear children are to their mothers. I brought you
forth with pain. Viérotchka, be grateful, be obedient ; you
yourself will see that it is for your own good. Behave
as I tell you.

To-morrow he will offer himself. "

“ Mámenka, you are mistaken. He has no thought of
offering himself. Mámenka, if you had heard what they said ! "
" I know .

If they were not talking about a wedding, then

it was about something else.

Da! let ' em try it ; they'll

find they've got the wrong ones to deal with. We'll bend
him into a ram's horn. I'll bring him into church in a bag ;

I'll drag him around the chancel by the whiskers, and he will
be glad of it. Nu ! but I have said enough . A young girl
should not know about these things ; it's the mother's busi-

ness.

But a young girl must be obedient ; she don't know

anything yet. Now will you speak with him as I tell you ? "
" Yes, I will speak with him ."
" And you, Pavel Konstantinuitch, what are you sitting up
for like a stump ! Tell her yourself that you, as her father,
command her to obey her mother, and that her mother will
certainly teach her no evil. "
" Marya Alekséyevna, you are a clever woman, but this is

rather a dangerous step ; if you don't look out, you will carry
things too far."

The proverb tells the truth : ' Don't touch filth if you don't
want to smell.' Perfect nonsense ! Don't argue, but answer ; must a daughter obey her mother or not ? "
" Of course she must ; what's the use of speaking, Marya
Alekséyevna ?"
" Nu ! give her your orders then, since you are her father."
" Viérotchka, obey your mother in everything . Your
mother is a clever woman, a woman of experience . She will
tell you nothing bad. I command you as your father."
The carriage stopped at the gate.
" That's enough, mámenka. I told you that I would
speak with him. I am very tired. I must rest."
" Go to bed; get some sleep. I shall not disturb you.
You must be fresh for to-morrow .

Sleep well. "

In fact, all the time that they were climbing the stairs ,
Marya Alekséyevna held her peace ; and it was a great
effort for her ; and what an effort it was for her to be pleas-

ant when Viérotchka went directly to her room, saying that
she did not care for tea ! and what an effort it was for her to

say in a pleasant voice, " Viérotchka, come to me. " The
daughter obeyed. " I want to give you my blessing before
you go to sleep, Viérotchka. Bend your little head." The
daughter bent her head. " May God bless you, Viérotchka,
as I bless you." She repeated the blessing thrice, and gave
her her hand to kiss .

" No , mámenka ! I told you long ago, that I would not
kiss your hand. And now let me go. I tell you the truth ;
I feel very bad. "
Akh ! how angry grew Marya Alekséyevna's eyes once
again ! But she controlled herself, and said gently, " Go on ,
go to bed."

It took Viérotchka a long time to undress , because she
was lost in thought. First she took off her bracelet, and sat
long with it in her hand; then she removed her ear-rings , and

forgot herself again. At last she remembered that she was
very tired.

She could not even stand before the looking-

glass, but threw herself into the chair in utter weariness .
She sat there some time before it came over her that she

must undress as quickly as possible ; but she had hardly
taken off her dress and laid down, before Marya Alekséyevna
came into the room with a waiter, whereon stood her father's
great cup and a pile of toasted bread.

" Take some, Viérotchka ; here, take some, for health's
sake ! I myself have brought it to you. You see your
mother looks out for you.

I was sitting and thinking , ' How

is it that Viérotchka went to bed without tea ?'

While I

was drinking I was full of thought. And here I have brought
it. Take it, my dear daughter [moya dotchka mílaïa] ."
Her mother's voice sounded strange to Viérotchka ; but in
reality, it was soft and kind ; it had never been so before.

She looked at her mother with amazement. Marya Alekséyevna's cheeks were fiery red, and her eyes were unsteady.
"Take it. I'll sit down and look atyou. When you have
finished this cup, I will bring you another."
The tea, which was half-filled with delicious, thick cream,

awakened Viérotchka's appetite. She lifted herself on her
elbow, and began to drink .
" How delicious tea is when it is fresh and strong, and

when it has lots of sugar and cream ! Perfectly delicious !
It is not like tea that has been drawn once , and is made with

one little mean bit of sugar, and tastes like medicine. When

I have money of my own, I shall always drink such tea as
this is. Thank you , mámenka. "
" Don't go to sleep yet ; I will bring you another one."
She came back with a second cup of the same excellent tea.

" Drink it, and I will stay with you." She said nothing for
amoment, and then suddenly she began to speak in a strange
way, sometimes so fast that her words could not be understood, and the next minute drawling .
" Now, Viérotchka, you have thanked me. It's a long time
since I have had any thanks from you. You think that I am
cross . Yes, I am cross. But it is impossible not to be cross .
But I am weak, Viérotchka ! After three punches, of course
I feel weak ! And think how old I am. Da! and you have
shaken my nerves, Viérotchka ; you pained me greatly ; and
so I felt weak. And my life is a hard one, Viérotchka ! I
don'twantyou to live such a life. Be a rich woman ! Think
of the suffering that I have gone through, Viérotchka,

by your standard, I ain't a good woman ; but then I be as I
be. Nádinka was born. Nu, what of that? Supposing she
was born ? Who taught me to do such things ? How did
your father get his place? My sin was much less than his .
And they took her away from me, and they put her into the
Foundling House; and it was impossible to find out what
became of her, and so I never saw her, and I don't know

whether she is among the livin' or not. Faith, how could she
be alive !

Nu, at the present time I should not have cared

so much, but then it wa'n't so easy, and my temper got the
best of me .

Nu, and so I became cross .

And since then

everything has gone all right. Who got the situation for your
father, fool that he is ? I got it for him. And who got him
promoted to be a manager ? I did ; and so we began to live
comfortably. And why? Because I lost my temper and my
good name ! This I know. It's written in your books, Viérotchka, that it's only the wicked and ill-tempered who get
along in this world ; and that is gospel truth, Viérotchka !
Now your father has lots of money, Viérotchka ; and it was
through me that he got it. And I too have money, and
probably more than he has,- all through my exertions. I
shall have bread enough for my last years. And your father,
fool that he is, has begun to respect me, and he has to toe
the line.

I scold him well.

But before, he used to treat me

mean. And why was it ? I didn't deserve it then.

suppose I know it ? Yes, and it is written in your books ,
too, that to live otherwise one must reform things ; but accordin' to the present way of the world one can't live as
the books say. But why don't they reform the world ?
Ekh ! Viérotchka, you think that I don't know what kind of

rules are in your books . I know ; they are fine. But we
sha'n't live to see 'em, you and me. Folks is too stupid ;
how can you make reforms with such folks ? Let's live in

Marya Alekséyevna was snoring ! She was fast asleep.
II .

MARYA ALEKSÉYEVNA knew what was spoken at the theatre ,

but she did not yet know what followed that conversation.
At the very time that she was getting more and more angry
with her daughter, and, in consequence of having put too
much rum in her punch, was snoring in her daughter's room,
Mikhaïl Ivanuitch Storeshnikof was taking supper in a certain fashionable restaurant with the other young gentlemen
who had accompanied him to the box.
There was still a fourth person in the company, - a French
girl who came with the officer.
The supper was almost
ended.
" Monsieur Storeshnik."

Storeshnikof felt greatly set up. The French girl addressed
him for the third time during the supper.

" Monsieur Storeshnik ! Allow me to address you so. It
sounds better and is much easier to speak .

I did not think

that I was going to be the only lady in your company ; I
hoped to see Adèle here. That would have been charming,
I see her so seldom. "

" Adèle unfortunately has quarrelled with me."
The officer wanted to say something,but he did not speak.
" Don't believe him, Mademoiselle Julie," said the civilian .

" He does not dare to tell you the truth ; he thinks that you
will not like it when you find out that he has given up a
French girl for a Russian . "

" I don't know why it was we came here," said the officer.
" Why, yes , Serge ; it was because Jean asked us. And
it has been very pleasant for me to get acquainted with Monsieur Storeshnikof. No, Monsieur Storeshnikof ; fy, what bad
taste you show ! I should never have said anything if you
had deserted Adèle for that Circassian beauty in whose box

you were sitting ; but to give up a French girl for a Russian !
I imagine her : colorless eyes, colorless, thin hair, a vacant,
colorless face. I beg pardon ; not colorless, but as you call
it, blood with cream [krof so slivkami] , and by that you
mean a dish which only your Esquimaux can take into their

mouths . -Jean,let that sinner against grace have the ash-tray.
Let him scatter ashes on his wicked head ! "

" You have spoken so much nonsense, Julie, that it ought
to be your head, not his, that should be sown with ashes ,"
said the officer. " It happens that the very girl whom you
called the Circassian was the Russian ."

" You are making sport of me ! "
" A genuine Russian," said the officer.
" Impossible ! "

" You are quite wrong, my dear Julie, if you think that
our nation has only one type of beauty, like your own. You
have a great many blondes, but we, Julie, are a mixture of
nations .

We have the white-haired like the Finns - "

" Yes, yes , the Finns ," said the French girl.
" And those with black hair, who are even darker than
"

Italians ; Tartars and Mongolians
" Yes , yes , Tartars and Mongolians ; I know about them,"
said the French girl again.

" And all of them have given us a share of their blood.
We have blondes, whom you may despise, but they are only
a local type ; a very common type, to be sure, but not predominating."

" That's strange. But she is lovely. Why doesn't she go
on the stage ? By the way, gentlemen, I only speak of what
I have seen. There remains a very important question, -her
foot. Your great poet Karasen, I have been told, said that
in all Russia there could not be found five pair of small,
straight little feet."

" Julie ! it was not Karasen who said that, and you had
better call him Karamzin.

Karamzin was a historian , and

he wasn't a Russian, but a Tartar. Now, here's a new proof
of the variety of our types. It was Pushkin who spoke about
the little feet. His poetry was very good in its day, but now

it has lost a large part of its value. By the way, the Esquimaux live in America, and our savages who drink the blood
of elans are called Samoyeds . "
" Thank you, Serge. Karamzin, historian ; Pushkin, I
know ; Esquimaux. in America ; the Russians are Samoyeds ;
yes , Samoyeds. That is such a lovely word : Sa-mo-ye-dui !
Now I shall remember it. Now, gentlemen, I shall ask
Serge to tell me all this again when we are alone. It is a
very profitable subject for conversation ; besides, science is
my hobby. I was born to be a Madame Staël, gentlemen.

But this is an episode entirely out of the track. Let us return
to the question ,

her foot."

" If you will allow me to call upon you to-morrow, Mademoiselle Julie, I shall have the honor of bringing you her
shoe ."

" Bring it. I will try it on. That appeals to my curiosity."
Storeshnikof was enraptured. Why ? Because he had
got into Jean's wake, and Jean was in Serge's wake, and
Julie- she was one of the most prominent of the French

ladies among all the French ladies of Serge's society. It was
an honor, a great honor."
" I don't care anything about her foot," said Jean ; "but
I as a practical man am interested in something beside her

foot. I want to see if she has a pretty figure."
" Her figure is very pretty," said Storeshnikof, who was
encouraged by the praise given his taste, and who thought at
the same time that he could give Julie a compliment. He
had not dared to do so before. " Her figure is charming,
although to praise another woman's figure here is certainly
blasphemy."

" Ha ! ha ! ha ! this gentleman wants to make a compliment on my figure ! I am neither a hypocrite nor a liar, Monsieur Storeshnik, and I don't praise myself, nor can I endure
that others should flatter what is bad in me .

Thank God, I

have something for which I can honestly be praised. But
my figure ! ha ! ha ! ha ! Jean, you can tell him whether my
figure is worth praising. Jean, why don't you speak ? Your
hand , Monsieur Storeshnik. "

She seized his hand .

" See

here ! Now you will know that I am not all that I seem ! I
have to wear a padded dress, just as I wear a petticoat, not
because I like it. No, in my opinion it would be better without such hypocrisy, but because it is the fashion. But a
woman who has lived as I have , and how have I lived Monsieur Storeshnik ? I am a saint now compared to what I

have been ; such a woman cannot preserve her beauty ! "
And suddenly she burst into tears, - " My beauty ! My
beauty ! my lost innocence ! Oh God, why was I born ? "
" You lie, gentlemen ! " she cried, jumping up and pounding
with her fist on the table.

" You are slanderers .

You are

low fellows . She is not his mistress. He is trying to buy
her. I saw how she turned away from him ; how she burned
with indignation and with scorn .

It was contemptible."

" Yes," said the civilian, lazily stretching himself, " you

have boasted a little prematurely, Storeshnikof ; you have
not caught your fish yet, and yet you said that she was yours,
and that you had broken with Adèle so as to deceive us the
better. Yes, you gave us a very good description, but you
described to us what you had not seen yet ; however, it's
no matter.

A week sooner or later makes no difference .

You must not be discouraged about drawing on your imagination for stories. You will get on even better than you
thought. I have been there ; you will be satisfied."
Storeshnikof was beside himself with anger.

" No, Mad-

emoiselle Julie, you are mistaken ; I venture to assure you
that you are mistaken in your conclusion ; forgive me for
daring to contradict you, but she is my mistress. That was
an ordinary lover's quarrel because she was jealous ; she saw
that I was sitting in Mademoiselle Mathilde's box during the
first act ; that's all."

" That's a lie, my dear, that's a lie," said Jean, yawning.
" I don't tell lies ! I don't tell lies ! "

" Prove it. I am a positive man, and I don't believe anything without proofs."
" What proofs can I bring you ? "
" Now here you are backing out, and you as good as confess that you lie. What proofs ? As if it would be hard to
show them.

Now, then, here's for you : to-morrow we will

meet here again at supper. Mademoiselle Julie will be good
enough to bring her Serge ; I shall bring my dear little
Berthe ; you bring her. If you bring her, I am the loser,
the supper shall be at my expense. If you don't bring her,
you shall be driven out from our circle in disgrace.- Jean,
touch the bell." The servant appeared. " Simon, be good
enough to get supper for six people to-morrow ; one just like
the one that I had when Berthe and I were married at your

house-do you remember ? -before Christmas, and have it
in this very room ! "
" How could I ever forget such a supper, Monsieur ? It
:

shall be done. "

The servant went out .

" You contemptible, miserable men ! Two years I lived
as a bad woman in a house with prostitutes and thieves, and
never once did I meet three such low people as you are !
Mon Dieu ! what sort of people do I have to live with in
society ? Why must I suffer such disgrace, O God ! " She
fell on her knees : “ O God, I am a feeble woman ! I could

bear hunger, but in Paris the winters were so cold. The

cold was so bitter, and the temptations were so overpowering. I wanted to live ; I wanted to love. O God, that was
no sin ! Why art thou punishing me so ? Deliver me from
this band.

Lift me out of this mire.

Give me strength to

become even a bad woman again in Paris; I ask of Thee
nothing else : I deserve nothing else. Only deliver me
from these men, from these contemptible men ! "
She jumped up, and ran to the officer : " Serge, are you
too like the rest ? No, you are better."
" Better ? " repeated the officer, phlegmatically.
" Isn't this thing contemptible ? "
" It is , Julie ."

" And you don't protest? You allow it? You agree to it ?
You share in it ?

" Sit on my knee, my dear Julie." He began to caress
her, and she grew calmer. " How I love you at such
moments ! You are a glorious woman. Now, why don't
you consent to go through the marriage ceremony with me ?
How many times have I asked you to ? Give your consent."
" Marriage ? the bridle ? conventionality ? Never ! I have
forbidden you to mention such absurdities. Don't get me
angry. But Serge, dear Serge, forbid him; he is afraid of
you
. Save her ! "
" Julie, be calmer. This is impossible. If not he, then
somebody else ; what difference does it make ? Just look

here. Jean is already thinking of getting her away from
him, and there are thousands of such Jeans, as you know
well.

It is impossible to save the daughter when her mother

is anxious to sell her.

You can't knock down a wall with

your forehead ,' we Russians say. We are a clever people,
Julie. You see how calmly I live, accepting this Russian
principle of ours ."
" Never ! You are a slave !

The French woman is free .

The French woman struggles , may fall, but still she struggles .
I will not allow this.
Do you know ? "

Who is she ?

Where does she live ?

" I know ."

" Let us go to her. I am going to warn her."
" What ! at one o'clock at night? No, let us go home.Au revoir ! Jean.- Au revoir ! Storeshnikof . - Of course,

you will not expect Julie and me at your supper, to-morrow.
You see how excited she is. And I also, to tell you the
truth, don't like this business at all. Of course, my opinion
has nothing to do with you. Au revoir ! "

" What a crazy Frenchwoman ! " said the civilian, stretching himself and yawning, as the officer and Julia left. "A
very piquante woman, but this is too much. It is very pleasant to see a nice little woman get warmed up ; but I would
not live with her four hours , let alone four years .

Of course ,

Storeshnikof, our supper will not be destroyed by her caprice. I shall bring Paul and Mathilde in their place.
And now it's time to go home. I have got to call on
Berthe , and then I must go and see the little Lottchen, who
is mighty pretty. "
III .

" Nu, Viéra, all right ! Your eyes show you haven't cried.
Evidently you saw that your mother tells the truth. You
always used to be an off horse." Viérotchka made an impatient gesture. " Nu ! its all right ; I shan't say anything
more ; don't get stirred up ! And last night I fell asleep in
your room ; perhaps I talked too long. Last night I was
not myself. Don't heed what I said when I was a little

tipsy ; do you hear ? don't heed it ! "
Viérotchka once more saw the ordinary Marya Alekséyevna.
The evening before it seemed to her that underneath her

animal outside she saw the features of a human being ; but
now she seemed to be a mere animal and nothing else.

Viérotchka made an effort to overcome her repugnance, but
she could not. Hitherto she had only despised her mother ;
yesterday evening it seemed to her that she was ceasing to
despise her and beginning to feel only pity for her. But now
again she felt the old repugnance, but there remained also
the pity for her.
" Dress yourself, Viérotchka. He'll likely get here before long." She very carefully examined her daughter's
wardrobe. " If you only behave yourself, I will make you
a present of a pair of ear-rings with large emeralds ; they
are old fashioned, but if they are made over, they'll make a
handsome little brooch. They were left in pawn for one
hundred and fifty rubles, making with interest two hundred
and fifty ; but they are worth more than four hundred. Do
you hear ? I am going to give them to you."
Storeshnikof appeared. Last evening he was quite at a
loss to know how to accomplish the task which he had undertaken; he walked from the restaurant to his house, thinking


======================================================================

all the time.

A VITAL QUESTION.

But when he reached home he was calm ; he

made up his mind as he walked, and now he was satisfied
with himself .
He asked about Viéra Pavlovna's health .
" I am well."

He said that he was very glad, and the conversation turned
on the necessity of making the most of health.
" Of course it is necessary, and according to Marya
Alekséyevna's opinion, one ought to make the most of youth
also. " He perfectly agreed with that sentiment, and thought
that it would be well to take advantage of the fine weather

to enjoy a ride out of town : " It is a frosty day, and the
road is elegant. "

"With whom do you intend to go ? "
" Only three of us,-you, Marya Alekséyevna, Viéra Pavlovna, and myself."

In this case Marya Alekséyevna is perfectly agreed ; but
now she is going to prepare some coffee and lunch, and
Viérotchka will sing something .

" Viérotchka, will you sing something ?" she adds in a
tone that leaves no room for refusal .

" I will sing. "

Viérotchka sat down at the piano, and sang a song called
" Troika" (The Three Span) , for at this time Pushkin's
poem was set to music. To Marya Alekséyevna listening at
the door, this song was very good. The young girl was
looking at the officer. " That little Viérka, if she only wants ,
can be pretty shrewd, the minx ! "
Soon Viérotchka stopped. This was right ; Marya Alekséyevna had advised her : " Sing a little while, and then
begin to talk. "
Now Viérotchka is speaking, but to Marya Alekséyevna's
mortification she is speaking in French. " What a fool I
was ! I forgot to tell her to speak in Russian ; but Viéra
is speaking calmly ; she is smiling. Nu ! evidently everything is going well. Only what made him open his eyes so
wide ? But then, he is a fool [durak] , a genuine fool, and
all that he can do is to blink his eyes. But this is just the
kind we want. Now she is giving him her hand ; Viérka is
smart ; I praise her ! "

" Monsieur Storeshnikof, I must speak seriously with you .
Last night you took a box so that you might represent me to

your friends as your mistress. I am not going to tell you that

itwas dishonorable ; if you had been capable of comprehending
it, you would not have done it. But I warn you, if you ever
dare to speak to me in the theatre, or on the street, or anywhere else, I shall slap your face. My mother will torture
me
(here Viérotchka smiled) " let come what may, it is
all the same . This evening you receive a note from my
mother to the effect that our sleighride is given up, because
‫دو‬

I am not well."

He stood up and blinked his eyes, just as Marya Alekséyevna had noticed.
" I speak to you as to a man who has not a spark of honor
in him. But may be you are not absolutely ruined. If it is

so, I beg of you, cease calling upon us ! Then I will forgive
your slander. If you consent, give me your hand. "
She offered him her hand ; he took it, hardly knowing what
he was doing.

" I thank you.

Now go.

Say that you must hurry to get

the horses ready for the drive ."

Again he blinked his eyes. She turned to the notes and
began to finish singing the " Troika. " It was a pity that
there were no good judges of singing there ; it was charming
to hear her ; indeed , it was rare that one heard so much ex-

pression put into music. Really, there was too much feeling ;
it was not artistic .

In a moment Marya Alekséyevna came in, and the cook
followed her with a waiter containing coffee and lunch.

Mikhaïl Ivanuitch, instead of taking the lunch, retreated to
the door .

" Where are you going, Mikhail Ivanuitch ? "
" I am in a hurry, Marya Alekséyevna, to give orders
about the horses ."

" Da ! you have ample time, Mikail Ivanuitch."
Mikhaïl Ivanuitch was already behind the door.

But

Marya Alekséyevna dashed from the reception room into
the parlor with uplifted fists . " What have you done, you
confounded Viérka. Ha? " But the confounded Viérka
was no longer in the parlor ; her mother hastened after her
to her room, but the door of Viérotchka's room was locked.

The mother pressed with all the strength of her body to
break open the door, but the door did not yield, and Viérka
said : " If you try to break open the door, I shall open the

window and call for help. I will not give myself into your
hands alive."


======================================================================

A VITAL QUESTION.

Marya Alekséyevna's anger lasted long, but she did not
break open the door ; finally, she got tired of shouting. Then
Viérotchka said : " Mámenka, hitherto I simply have not
loved you ; but since last night, I pity you ; you have had
much sorrow , and that has made you what you are . Hitherto
I have not talked with you, but now I want to talk ; but

only when you have got over being angry. We will talk

kindly, as we never have before. "
Of course, Marya Alekséyevna did not take these words
much to heart ; but weary nerves demand rest, and Marya

Alekséyevna began to reason whether it would not be better
to compromise with her daughter before she, the miserable
creature , gets entirely out of her hands . " Besides , without

her, nothing can be done ; we can't marry her to Mishka, the
fool , unless she's here to marry him, can we ?

Besides , I

don't know yet what she has told him ; they squeezed each
other's hands ; what does that signify ? "
And thus the weary Marya Alekséyevna was reasoning
between ferocity and cunningness , when suddenly the bell
rang. It was Julie and Serge.
IV .

" SERGE, does her mother speak French? " were Julie's
first words when she awoke .

" I don't know ; so you have not put that idea out of your
head yet ?"
" No , I have not."

And after taking into consideration all that they had seen
in the theatre, they decided that in all probability this young
girl's mother did not speak French. So Julie took Serge
along with her as interpreter. At all events, such was his
fate, and he would have had to go even if Viérotchka's mother

had been the Cardinal Mezzofanti ; 1 and he did not complain
of his fate, but went everywhere with Julie, as though he
were maid of honor to some heroine ! Julie got up late, but
on the way she stopped at Wickman's , and then, though it
was not on her way , she went to four other stores because she

needed certain articles . It was in this way that Mikhaïl

Ivanuitch had ample time to explain himself, Marya Alekséyevna had ample time to get enraged and to get calmed

down, before Julie and Serge came from the Liteinaïa bridge
to the Gorokhovaïa Street .
1Mezzofanti (Giuseppe Gaspardo) , chief keeper of the Vatican library, was said
to have spoken over one hundred languages.

" But what excuse have we for coming here ? Fy, what
miserable stairs !

I never saw such even in Paris ! "

" It's all the same ; make up an excuse. Her mother keeps
a sort of a pawn shop. Take off your brooch ! Hold on !
here's a better one : she gives piano lessons. Let's say
that you have a niece."
Matrióna for the first time in her life was ashamed of her

smashed cheek-bone when she saw Serge's uniform, and
especially Julie's magnificence ; she had never before met
face to face with a woman of such importance. Marya
Alekséyevna was in such a state of wonder and indescribable

surprise when Matrióna announced that Colonel N- Nwith his spouse had done themselves the honor of calling !
especially those words " with his spouse " !
The gossip that permeated into the circle where Marya
Alekséyevna moved, affected exclusively the class of civilians ,
but the gossip about genuine aristocrats died away in the air
before it reached half way down to Marya Alekséyevna ;
therefore she accepted in the full legal interpretation of the

thought the words husband and wife, as Serge and Julie
called each other, in accordance with the Parisian fashion.

Marya Alekséyevna quickly composed herself and hastened
down to meet them .

Serge said that he was very glad of the chance that he had
had the evening before, etc., that his wife had a niece, etc. ,
that his wife did not speak Russian, and therefore he was
interpreter.

" Yes , I may be grateful to my Creator," said Marya
Alekseyevna ; “ Viérotchka has a great talent for teaching
the piano, and I should count it a great piece of luck if she
were to visit such a house as yours. Only my little teacher
is not very well just now. "
Marya Alekséyevna spoke particularly loud, so that Viérotchka might hear and understand the approaching truce.
She herself in her admiration, as it were, devoured her
visitors with her eyes .

" I don't know whether she's got the strength to come out
and give you a proof of her skill on the piano.-Viérotchka,
my love, can you come out or not ? Only some strangers there won't be a scene - why won't you come out ? "
Viérotchka opened the door, glanced at Serge, and turned
crimson with shame and anger.

Even unobservant eyes

could not have failed to take notice of this, and Julie's eyes

were sharper, if that were possible, than even Marya Alekséyevna's. The French woman began without beating around
the bush :

" My dear child, you are surprised and indignant to see a
man in whose presence you were so much offended last night,
and who probably himself gave you some reason for offence.

My husband is thoughtless ; but for all that, he is far better
than the rest of the lazy young fellows. Please forgive him
for my sake ; I came to you with good intentions. The
lessons for my niece was only a pretence ; but it is necessary
to keep it up for a while. Please play us something - something quite short ; then you and I will go to your room, and
we'll talk the matter over . Listen to me , my child. "
Can this be the same Julie who is so well known among

the aristocratic young bloods of Petersburg ? Can this be
the same Julie who plays such tricks as make even devil-maycare young fellows blush ? No, it is a princess to whose ears
a rough word never came !

Viérotchka sat down to show her skill on the piano. Julie
stood behind her ; Serge engaged himself in conversation

with Marya Alekséyevna, with the view of finding out what
the relationship was between her and Storeshnikof. In the
course of a few minutes Julie stopped Viérotchka, put her
arm around her waist, walked with her up and down the

parlor, then went with her to her room. Serge explained
that his wife was satisfied with Viérotchka's playing ,
but wanted to speak with her because it was necessary also
to know the teacher's character, etc. , and he continued to

talk with Marya Alekséyevna about Storeshnikof. All this
was excellent, but Marya Alekséyevna found reason for
greater suspicion and vigilance.
" My dear child," said Julie, as she entered Viérotchka's
room, " your mother is a very bad woman . But in order that

I may know what to say to you, I beg of you to tell me how
and why you went to the theatre last night.

I know all

about it already from my husband, but from your story I
shall learn your character. Don't be afraid of me. " And
when she had heard Viérotchka's account, she continued : -

" Yes , one can speak plainly with you ; you have character. " And in very careful, delicate terms she told the
story of the wager that had been made the evening before ;

whereupon Viérotchka told her about the invitation to go to
ride.


======================================================================

" Now do you suppose he wanted to deceive your mother,

or were they both in a conspiracy against you ? "
Viérotchka began to aver with much warmth that her
mother was not such a bad woman as to be in a conspiracy.

" It won't take me long to find out," said Julie. " You
stay here ; you are not needed there." Julie returned to the
parlor.
" Serge, he has invited this woman and her daughter to

take a ride this evening. Tell her about last night's supper. "
" Your daughter is agreeable to my wife ; now it is necessary to see about her terms ; in all probability we shall not
have any trouble on that score.

But allow me to finish our

talk about our mutual friend. You give him very high
praise, but are you aware of the way that he talks about his
relationship to your family ? For example, do you know why
he invited us last evening to your box ? "

In Marya Alekséyevna's eyes there gleamed, instead of a
look of anxious inquiry, the thought, " Then it is so ! "
" I am not a gossip," she replied with dissatisfaction. " I
myself do not carry tattle around, and I don't listen much to
the tattle of others . " This was said not without sarcasm , in
spite of all her admiration of her visitor. “ There are always

a good many little things that young people talk about among
themselves ; there is no need of bothering with them."
" Very good; well then,do you call this also gossip ? "
He began to tell the story of the supper. Marya Alekséyevna
did not let him finish ; as soon as he said the first word about

the wager, she leaped to her feet and cried out in wrath , entirely forgetting the importance of her guests : " Now what sort of tricks are these !

Akh ! the villain !

Akh ! the murderer ! Now I see why he invited us to go
a-driving ! He wanted to get me out of the way so as to
ruin a defenceless young girl ! Akh ! the beastly man ! "
and so she went on. Then she began to thank her guests for
-salvation of her life and her daughter's honor. " And so

that was what you were driving at, bátiushka ; I suspicioned
it at the very first, that you did not come without some good
reason ; lessons is lessons , but I saw that you had some
other game ; but I did not think that was the reason ; I

thought that you had some other bride for him, that you
wanted to take him away from us ; I have been unjust to
you, poor sinner that I am ; be generous and forgive me !


======================================================================

A VITAL QUESTION.

You have done me such a great favor that I shall never

forget it as long as I live. " And thus she went on pouring
out curses , blessings, excuses, in a disorderly torrent.
Julie did not listen long to this endless speech, the meaning of which was plain to her from the tone of her voice,
and from her gestures. While Marya Alekséyevna was
speaking the very first words, the French woman got up and
returned to Viérotchka's room .

" No, your mother was not his accomplice, and now she is
very indignant with him. But I know such people as your
mother very well. They can't long hold out in their dislike
of people who have money.

She will soon be on the look-

out for a husband for you again, and what will be the end
of it all, God knows . At all events, it will be very hard for
you. At first she will leave you in peace ; but I tell you it
will not last long. What are you going to do now ? Have
you any relatives in Petersburg ? "
" No."

" That is too bad. Have you a lover ? "
Viérotchka did not know how to answer this ; she only
opened her eyes in wonder.
" Forgive me, forgive me ; I might have known that, but
so much the worse. Of course, then you have no one to

protect you . What can be done ? Now listen ; I am not
what I seemed to you at first. I am not his wife ; we only
live together. I am known in all Petersburg as a very bad
woman, but I am an honest woman. To visit me would cost
you your reputation ; it is sufficiently risky for you that I have
called at your rooms only once, and to call upon you a second time would be sure ruin . Meantime it is necessary for

me to see you again, and probably more than once ; that is, if
you have any confidence in me. Yes ? Then what time can
I see you to-morrow ? "
" About twelve o'clock," said Viérotchka.

This was

rather too early for Julie, but all right ; she would give
orders to be called at that time, and she would meet Viérotchka at the Gostinui Dvor,¹ opposite the Nevsky Prospekt .
This place is not so much frequented as the others ; it will be
easier to find each other, and no one knows Julie there .

" Yes , and here is another lucky thought ; give me a piece
of paper ; I'll write a note to that contemptible fellow, and

Saint Petersburg.

so get him into my power." Julie wrote, “ Monsieur Storeshmkof, you are now in all probability in great embarrassment ; if you wish to get out of it, come to my house at
seven o'clock .

M. le Tellier . "

" Now, good by. "
Julie offered her hand, but Viérotchka threw herself on

her neck, kissed her, wept, and kissed her again, and Julie
was still less able to bear it ; she sbed tears still more

abundantly than Viérotchka ; the feeling that she was doing
a noble deed gave her such happiness and pride that it was
very touching ; she went into ecstasies, she kept on speaking ,

always with tears and kisses, and finally she ended with an
exclamation : -

" My friend ! my dear child ! may God spare you from
knowing what I am feeling now, when, for the first time in
many years , pure lips touch mine. Die, but don't give a
kiss without love ! "
V.

STORESHNIKOF's plan was not so murderous as Marya Alekséyevna supposed ; she in her own style put it in a too bru-

tal form, but the spirit of the thing she interpreted aright.
Storeshnikof's idea was to bring the two ladies a little later
in the evening to the restaurant where the supper was going

to be ; of course, they would be hungry and cold, and it
would be necessary for them to get warm, and have a cup of
tea. He would have a little opium put into Marya Alekséyevna's teacup or wineglass ; Viérotchka would be frightened to see her mother lose consciousness ; he would take

Viérotchka into the room where the supper was going on,
and then his bet would be won ; what the final result would

be, he would leave to chance. Maybe Viérotchka in her
perplexity would not understand the matter, and would
agree to remain in the strange company, but even if she
remained but a little while, it would not make any difference ; it would be excused because she had only just entered

upon that adventurous course of life, and naturally felt a
bit of awkwardness at first. Then afterwards he would buy
Marya Alekséyevna off with a little money, after which he
would have nothing more to do with her.
But now what was he to do ?

He cursed his boastfulness

before his friends , his faint-heartedness when met by Vié-

rotchka's unexpected and abrupt resistance ; he wished that


======================================================================

36

the earth would open and swallow him. Now what was he

to do? While his mind was in such disorder and despair, a
letter from Julie brought healing balm to his wound ; a ray
of hope shone into the impenetrable darkness ; a solid road

opened through the quagmire under the feet of the sinking
man .

" Oh ! she can ; she is the cleverest woman ; she can

bring anything about ! She is the noblest of women ! "
At ten minutes before seven he was standing before her
door. " She is waiting for you, and gave orders to have you
admitted ."

How majestically she is sitting ! how stern she looks !
She scarcely bends her head in reply to his bow : " I am
very glad to see you ; take a seat."
Not a muscle moved in her face.

:

" It will be a good

scolding [lit. head-washing] , I suppose ; no matter, scold
away, only save me."
" Monsieur Storeshnik," she began in a cold, slow way,
" you know my opinion of the matter in regard to which we
have come together now, and which, of course, I see no need
of characterizing again. I have seen that young lady whom
you were talking about last night ; I have heard about your
visit to them to-day ; consequently, I know all about every-

thing, and I am very glad, because it saves me from asking
you any questions. Your position is perfectly clear, not
only to you, but to me."
" Lord ! I'd rather she would scold," thought the victim .
" It seems to me," she went on , " that you cannot get out

of it without somebody's help, and that you cannot expect
anybody to help you successfully but me. If you have anything to say in your defence, I will listen ." " And so,"
after a pause, " you , as well as I, suppose that no one else
is able to help you ; just listen to what I am able and willing
to do for you : if my supposititious help is going to be of
any use to you, I will tell you the terms on which I agree to
accomplish it."

And in the long, long style of an official explanation, she
told him that she could send a letter to Jean in which she

would say, " that, after last night's caprice, she had thought
things over ; that she wanted to take part in the supper, but
that she was engaged for this evening, and therefore she
asked Jean to persuade Storeshnikof to postpone the supper
till some time that should be agreed upon with Jean." She
read the letter over ; the letter expressed a conviction that


======================================================================

A VITAL QUESTION.

37

Storeshnikof would win the wager, and that it would be disagreeable to him to put off his triumph . " Would this letter
be sufficient ? "
Indeed, it would." " In such a case," continued Julie , in the very same style of official notes ; she would

send off the letter on two conditions : " You can accept
them or not ; if you accept them, I will send off the letter ;
if you refuse them, I shall burn the letter ; " and all this was
said in the everlasting manner that seemed to draw out the
soul of the rescued man . At last came the conditions ;

there were two : " First, that you cease persecuting the young
person of whom we were speaking ; second, that you cease
mentioning her name in your conversations ."
" Is that all ? " the rescued man wonders : " I thought she
would ask, the deuce knows what, and I should have been

willing to grant anything." He agrees, and his face shows
a triumph at the easiness of her conditions ; but Julie is not
in the least softened, and she keeps on with her explanations .
" The first is necessary for her sake ; the second
also for her sake, but still more for yours. I shall postpone
the supper for a week, and then for another week ; and then
the thing will be forgotten : but you must understand that

the others will forget about it only unless you do not any
longer say a single word about the young lady about whom,
etc." And at the same time she keeps on explaining and
assuring him that the letter will be received by Jean in ample
time. " I have made inquiries , and he will dine with Berthe ,

etc.; he will call on you as soon as he has finished his cigar,
etc."

And this too was said as before ; then she said,

" And so the letter will be sent, and I am very glad ; please
read it over ; I have no confidence in others , and I do not

expect others to have confidence in me. You have read it
over : please seal it yourself. Here is an envelope ; I will
ring the bell. - Pauline , have the goodness to post this letter ,
etc. Pauline , I have not seen Monsieur Storeshnikof to-

day ; do you understand ? he has not been here ! "
This tormenting salvation lasted about an hour. Finally
the letter was sent off, and the rescued man breathes more

freely, but the perspiration runs down his face, and Julie
continues : -

" In a quarter of an hour you must hurry home, so that
Jean may find you there .

But this quarter of an hour is still

at your disposal, and I am going to avail myself of it to say
a few words to you ; you will follow or you will not follow


======================================================================

the advice which they contain, but you will at least think it
over seriously. I shall not say a word about the obligations
that an honorable man feels towards a young girl whose good
name he has compromised ; I know too well our aristocratic

young men to expect any advantage from going over this
side of the question. But I find that if you should marry the
young person about whom we have been speaking, it would
be a good thing for you. As a straightforward woman, I
shall lay down before you explicitly the foundations of my
belief, though some of them may be ticklish in your ears ;
however, your least word will be sufficient for me to stop .
You are a man of a weak character, and you run the risk of
falling into the hands of some bad woman who will torment

you and make you her mere plaything. But she is kind and
noble , and therefore she would not treat you shabbily. To
marry her, notwithstanding the lowness of her birth compared

to yours, notwithstanding her poverty, would help you along
in your career ; she, when once introduced into the ' great
world ' with all the money that you have, with all her beauty,
good sense, and strength of character, would occupy a brilliant place ; the advantage of this can be understood by every
husband. But aside from these advantages, which every
other husband would receive from such a wife, you, through
the peculiarities of your nature, more than any one else , need

an assistant. I will speak still plainer : you need some one
to lead you. Every word that I have spoken has been
weighed ; every word has been based on my observation of
her. I do not ask you to believe me, but I recommend that
you think over my advice. I doubt very much whether she
would accept your offer ; but if she should accept it, it would
be a good thing for you. I shall not detain you any longer ;
now you must hurry home. "
VI .

MARYA ALEKSEYEVNA , of course, did not even complain of

Viérotchka's refusal of the sleighride, after she found out
that that Mishka-durak was not at all such a durak as she

thought , and that he had almost got ahead of her. Viérotchka was left in peace , and on the next morning, without

meeting with any hinderance, she started for the Gostinui
Dvor .

" It is freezing here ; I do not like cold weather," said


======================================================================

A VITAL QUESTION.

Julie. " We must go somewhere else ; but where ?
I'll be right back from this shop."

39

Wait.

She bought a thick veil for Viérotchka. " Put it on ; then
you can go with me without any fear. But don't lift your
veil until we are alone ! Pauline is very modest, but I don't
want that even she should see you. I am too careful of you ,
my child ! "
In fact she herself wore her maid's cloak and bonnet and

a thick veil.

When Julie got warm, she listened to all the

news that Viérotchka had to tell her ; then she told her in
turn about her interview with Storeshnikof.

" Now, my dear child, there is no doubt that he will make
you an offer. These young men are always getting over ears
in love when their flirting meets no response. Do you know,
my dear child, that you have treated him quite like an experienced coquette. Coquetry - I am speaking about genuine coquetry, not about foolish, stupid imitations of it, for
they are disgusting, like any other imitation of a good thing
coquetry , I say, means sense and tact in the way that a
woman treats a man. Therefore absolutely innocent girls
act without meaning it, exactly like experienced coquettes , if

only they have sense and tact. Maybe my motives will

partly influence him, but the main thing is your resistance.
However, he will make you an offer, and I advise you to
accept it."
" You who told me only yesterday that it was better to

die than give a kiss without love ? "
" My dear child, that was said in excitement : in moments

of excitement it is true and good. But life is prose and
calculation . "

" No ! never ! never !

He is contemptible ! this is abomin-

able ! I shall not lower myself ; let him devour me ; I'd
sooner jump out of the window - sooner go out and beg for
bread-but to give my hand to a contemptible, low man
no ! it is better to die ! "

Julie began to explain the advantages : " You will get rid
of your mother's persecutions ; you stand in danger of being

sold ; he is not bad, but only a little off ; a narrow man who
is not bad is better than any other husband for a woman of
strong character ; you would be mistress of the house."
She depicted the position of actresses , dancers , who do not

love their " husbands " but reign over them: " This is the
freest situation in the world for a woman, except that situa

tion of independence and power which society might grant
to a legally married woman ; that is , it might give her as
much independence as an actress has towards the admirer of
an actress ." 1

She spoke much ; Viérotchka spoke much ; they both got
excited. Viérotchka finally became pathetic.
" You call me fanciful, you ask me what I want from life .
I want neither to reign nor to be subjected ; I do not want to
deceive or to make pretence ; I do not want to regard the
opinions of others , to strive for what other people recommend
to me, without I feel the need of it. I am not used to riches

for myself they are not necessary ; why, then, should I
seek them only because others think that they are pleasant
for all people , and consequently must be pleasant for me ? I
have never gone into society, I have not known what it was
to shine, and as yet I have no desire to do so ; why , then ,

should I sacrifice anything for a brilliant situation, only
because according to the ideas of others it is pleasant? For
what I do not feel the slightest need of, I am not going to

sacrifice , I do not say myself, but even my slightest caprice.
I want to be independent and live in my own way ; I am prepared for whatever is needful for myself ; whatever is not
needful I do not want.

What will be necessary for me I do

not know ; you say, ' I am young and inexperienced, that I
shall change as time goes on,' – well, so be it ; when the time
comes , I shall change ; but now I do not want, do not want, do
not want, anything that I do not want ! But what do I want

now ? ' you ask. Well, I am sure I do not know. Do I want
to love a man ? I do not know ! It was only yesterday
morning I did not know when I got up that I was going to
want to love you ; and several hours before I began to love
you I did not know that I could love any one ; and I did not

know how I should feel when I felt love for you ; and so now
I do not know how I should feel to love a man ; I only know
that I do not want to be anybody's slave !

I want to be free !

I do not want to be under obligations to any one, so that
any one should dare to say to me, ' You must do something
for me .'

I want to do only what I have it in my heart to do,

and let others do the same ; I do not want to ask anything of
anybody ; I do not want to curtail anybody's freedom; I want
to be free myself ! "
1 In Russia a married woman has absolutely no legal power; the husband has all

the rights and privileges. Tchernuishevsky wants to develop the idea of allowing
married women equal right with husbands.

A VITAL QUESTION.

Julie listened and was lost in thought, and her face grew
red ; but then she could not help her face growing red when
she sat near a fire. She leaped to her feet, and said in a
broken voice : -

" Well, well, my child, I myself should have felt that way
if I had not been ruined.

But I am not corrupted by those

deeds that are generally thought to ruin a woman ; not by
what happened to me in the past, what I endured and suffered ; not because of those things was my body given over
to insult ; but because I was used to idleness, to luxury ; because I am not strong enough to live by myself ; because I
need other people ; because I try to please ; therefore I am

doing what I do not like to do, and this is wretchedness .
Don't listen to what I said, my child ; I have been trying to
ruin you . This is torment ; I cannot touch the pure without
polluting it. Avoid me, my child ; I am a bad woman ;
don't think about society ! They are all bad there, worse
than I am .

Where idleness is , there is abomination ; where

grandeur is , there is abomination. Run, run ! " 1
VII.

STORESHNIKOF kept thinking more and more frequently,
" Well, now, suppose I should take and marry her ? " What
happened to him was a very common thing, not only with
people of weak character of his stamp, but also not seldom
with people of more independent character. In the histories
of the nations such cases as his fill the volumes of Hume and

Gibbon, Ranke and Thierry ; men crowd only to one side
simply because they do not hear the words, " Now strive ,
brethren, to take the other side " ; and if by chance they
hear and turn to the other side of the circle, then they go to
crowding just as bad on the other side.

Storeshnikof had

heard and seen that rich young men were in the habit of taking poor and pretty young girls as mistresses . Well, and
so he tried to make Viérotchka his mistress .

No other word

had entered his head ; he heard the other word , " You might

marry her " ; well, now he begins to think about the word
1 The Russian poet Nekrásof says in his poem, " Ubogaïa i Naryadnaïa " (The
Poor Woman and the Luxurious) , of just such a girl as Julie : -

Svyet tiébya predaiot poraganyu
I okhotno proshchaïet drugoe;
Society condemns you to destruction,
But the rest of the world willingly forgives .


======================================================================

42

A VITAL QUESTION.

" wife," just as before he thought about the word " mistress ."

This is a universal characteristic, and Storeshnikof illus-

trates very clearly in his own case nine-tenths of the motives
in the history of the human race .

But historians and psy-

chologists say that in every special fact the universal cause
is " individualized," according to their expression, by local,
temporary, national, and personal elements, although they
-that is, these elements - are important ; for example, all
spoons , albeit they are spoons, yet whoever gobbles soup or
shchi with the spoon in his hand must examine that special
spoon . Therefore let us examine Storeshnikof !
The principal thing that Julie had said-as though she
had been reading all the Russian novels that treat of such

things - was this , Resistance strengthens desire.
The thought about Viérotchka took possession of Storeshnikof after the theatre with more power than ever before .

After exhibiting to his friends the mistress of his fancy, it
seemed to him that she was much more beautiful than he had

imagined. Beauty, just like intellect or any other valuable
thing, is treasured by the majority of people exactly according as it is reckoned by the general opinion. Everybody
sees that a handsome face is handsome, but to what degree
it is handsome, how can that be expressed unless its rank
takes a diploma ? Viérotchka, sitting in the gallery or in the
back row of the theatre , would not have been noticed ; but

when she appeared in a box in the second tier, a good many
opera-glasses were directed towards her ; and how many encomiums of her beauty did not Storeshnikof hear, when, after
seeing her to her carriage, he returned to the foyer. And
Serge ! Oh , what a refined taste he has ! And Julie ! Well ,
when such good fortune is hatched , there is no need of mak-

ing a choice as to the way of possessing it.
His self-love was stirred at the same time as his passion .

But it was touched also on the other side. " It is hardly
likely that she will accept you." What ! not accept him
with such a uniform and such an estate ? No , you are mistaken , Frenchwoman ; she will take it ; of course, she will,
she will !

There was still another reason of the same stamp. Storeshnikof's mother, of course, would oppose his choice ; his

mother is a representative of the world, and Storeshnikof
hitherto has stood in awe of his mother, and of course he has


======================================================================

43

A VITAL QUESTION.

been burdened by his dependence on her. For people who
have no strength of character it is very charming to think,
" I am not afraid.

I have a strong character."

Of course, there was also a desire to advance in his worldly
career through his wife .
And to all this there was added the fact that Storeshnikof
did not dare to show himself to Viérotchka in his former

rôle, and meantime he could not resist looking at her.

In a word, Storeshnikof each day thought more seriously
of getting married, and at the end of a week, when Marya
Alekséyevna, after returning from a late service, was sitting
down and thinking how she might catch him, he himself appeared, and made an offer of marriage.

Viérotchka did not

come out of her room, and so he could only speak with
Marya Alekséyevna. Marya Alekséyevna of course said
that she on her part looked upon it as a great honor, but as

a loving mother, she must know her daughter's mind, and
asks him to call for his answer on the next morning.
" Nu ! she's a trump, my girl Viéra," said Marya Aleksé-

yevna to her husband, surprised at such an abrupt turning of
the case ; " just see how she has got the young lad under
her thumb. And I was thinking and thinking, and did not
know how to put my wits to work ; I was thinking how much
bother it would cost me to catch him again ; I was thinking

how the whole affair was ruined, while she, my golubushka
[my darling, literally, little pigeon] , did not spoil it at all,
but brought it round all right. She knew how it was necessary to act. Nu ! she is cunning ; it's no use talkin'."
" The Lord inspires infants with wisdom," said Pavel
Konstantinuitch.

He seldom played any part in domestic life. But Marya
Alekséyevna was a stern observer of the good old traditions ,
and on such a solemn occasion as the telling her daughter
about the offer, she allowed her husband to take the role of

honor, which by right belongs to the head and ruler of the
family. Pavel Konstantinuitch and Marya Alekséyevna
seated themselves on the sofa, as on the most solemn place ,
and sent Matrióna to ask the baruishna to come to them .

" Viéra, "

Pavel Konstantinuitch began , - " Mikhaïl Iva-

nuitch has done us the honor of asking your hand. We
answered like loving parents that we would not compel you,
but we said that on our side we were glad.

be, will depend on our experience, that we have not dared to
ask God for such a husband for you. Do you agree, Viéra ? "
" No," said Viérotchka.

" What is that you say, Viéra? " cried Pavel Konstantinuitch. The thing was so plain that even he could cry out,
not asking his wife how to act.

" Have you lost your senses , you fool ? Repeat that if
you dare, you disobedient thing ! " cried Marya Alekséyevna,
doubling her fists against her daughter.

" Forgive me, mámenka," said Viéra, rising ; " if you
touch me, I will leave the house ; if you lock me up, I will
jump out of the window. I knew how you would take my
refusal, and I have resolved how to act.
sit down, or I shall go . "

Take a seat, and

Marya Alekséyevna sat down again. " What a piece of
stupidity ! that front door is not under lock and key ; she
would push away the bolt in a second ; we could not ketch
her. She would run away ! she is crazy ! "
" I shall not marry him ! Without my consent, they can't
marry me ! "

" Viéra, you are losing your senses," said Marya Alekséyevna in a choking voice.
" How can that be? What answer can we give him tomorrow ? " exclaimed her father .

" You are not to blame towards him, but I will not consent."

This scene lasted about two hours. Marya Alekséyevna
was in a stew ; twenty times she began to cry out, and

clench her fists, but Viérotchka said : " Don't get up, or I
shall leave ! "

They kept beating about the bush, but they

could not do anything.

It ended when Matrióna came in to

ask whether she would put on the dinner.

" The pirog [pie]

was overdone ."

" Think till evening, Viéra. Come to your senses, you
fool ! " said Marya Alekséyevna, and whispered something to
Matrióna .

“ Mámenka, you are going to do something to me ! to take
out the key from my bedroom, or something else. Don't
you do it, or it will be worse ! "

Marya Alekséyevna said to the cook, " No matter.

What

a beast she is ! this Viérka ! If it were not that he wanted

her on account of her face, I would beat her till she bled !

But now how can I touch her ? She will disfigure herself,
the confounded fool ! "

They went in to dinner. They dined quietly. After dinner Viérotchka went to her room.

Pavel Konstantinuitch

lay down, as he usually did, to take a nap, but this time the
nap was a failure. As soon as he closed his eyes, Matrióna
came in and said that the khozyáïka's manservant was there ;
that the landlady asks Pavel Konstantinuitch to call upon her

immediately.

Matrióna was trembling like an aspen leaf.

Why should she tremble ?
VIII .

How could Matrióna help trembling when the whole
trouble arose through her ? As soon as she called Viérotchka to her pápenka and mámenka, she immediately ran off
to tell the wife of the khozydïka's cook how " your barin is
courting our baruishna " ; they called the youngest of the
khozyćïka's chambermaids , and began to blame her for her
unfriendliness in not having told them anything about it before. The youngest chambermaid could not understand
what the secret was that they blamed her for not telling :
she had never concealed anything . They told her when she
said, " I have not concealed anything," that they were sorry
for reproaching her for concealing anything. She ran off to
tell the news to the oldest of the chambermaids ; the oldest
of the chambermaids said, " Of course, he has done this

without his mother's knowledge, because I have not heard
anything, and I must know everything that Anna Petrovna
knows," and she went off to tell the whole story to the bar-

uina; such was the mischief caused by Matrióna ! " Mv
confounded little tongue has made me a great deal of
bother," she thought. " Marya Alekséyevna will find out
who let the cat out of the bag." But it happened that Marya
Alekséyevna forgot to ask who told of it.
Anna Petrovna could not say anything else but akh and
okh : twice she fell in a swoon, even while she was alone

with the senior chambermaid.

Of course, she was greatly

shocked , and she summoned her son. The son appeared .
" Michel, is it true what I have heard ? " in a tone of indignant suffering .
" What have you heard, maman ? ”

" That you have offered yourself to this - to this - to
this - to the daughter of our manager ! ”
" I have , maman. ”

" Without asking your mother's consent ?"
" I intended to ask your consent after I had obtained hers."
" I presume that you were surer of her consent than of

" Maman , it is the fashion nowadays to get the girl's
consent first, and to speak to relations afterwards . "

" Is that your fashion ? Maybe it is also your fashion for
the sons of good families to marry God knows whom, and
for the mothers to consent to it ?”

“ But, maman, she is not a God-knows-whom ' ; when you
come to know her you will approve of my choice."
“ “ When I know her ! ' I shall never know her ! I approve ofyour choice ' ! I forbid any thought of this choice !
Do you hear ? I forbid it ! "
“ Maman, this is not the fashion nowadays ; I am not a

little boy to be lead around by the hand by you. I know
myself where I am going . "
" Akh ! " Anna Petrovna shut her eyes .

Mikhaïl Ivanuitch had to yield before Marya Alekséyevna,
to Julie , to Viérotchka, because they were women of sense
and strong character ; but here, as far as sense was concerned,

the battle was drawn, and if the mother was stronger by
reason of her character, still the son felt solid ground under
his feet ; he had stood in awe of his mother hitherto through
habit, but they both remembered very well that in reality the

khozyáïka was not the khozyáïka, but only the mother of the
khozydïn ; and again that the khozydïka's son is in reality not

the khozyáïka's son, but the khozydïn. And therefore the
khozyáïka hesitated to use the decided word " forbid " ; she

prolonged the conversation, hoping to defeat her son and
get him tired out before a genuine battle was fought. But
the son had gone to such lengths that it was impossible to
withdraw, and he was compelled by the necessity of the case
to fight it out.

“ Maman , I assure you that a better daughter you could
not have."

" You torment ! your mother's murderer ! "
" Maman, let us reason about it coolly. Sooner or later
I shall have to get married, and a married man must have
greater expenses than a bachelor. I could, of course, marry
such a woman that all the income of the estate would have to

be spent on my establishment. But she will be a dutiful
daughter, and we could live with you just as I always have. "

" Torment ! my murderer ! get out of my sight ! "
" Maman, don't be angry ; I am not in the least to
blame ! "

" Marry such a wench, and not to blame ! "
" Now, maman, I am going to leave you. I do not want
you to call her such names in my presence."
" My murderer ! "
Anna Petrovna fell in a swoon , and Michel went off, satisfied with the courageous way in which he had carried out the
first scene , which was the most important of all.

Seeing that her son was gone, Anna Petrovna recovered
from her swoon. Her son has absolutely escaped from her
power ! In response to her “ Iforbid ” he explains that the
house is his ! Anna Petrovna thought and thought ; she
poured out her grief before the senior chambermaid, who in
these circumstances shared absolutely in the khozydïka's feelings of contempt for the manager's daughter ; she consulted
with her and sent for the manager.

" Hitherto I have been very well satisfied with you, Pavel
Konstantinuitch; but now these intrigues, in which possibly
you have had no share, may compel me to quarrel with
you."

" Your ladyship,¹ I am not to blame in the slightest degree,
'fore God ! ”

" I knew long ago that Michel was hanging around your
daughter. I did not put a stop to it, because a young man
cannot live without recreation. I am willing to make allowances for the mischief of young men, but I cannot endure
that my family should be degraded. How did your daughter
dare to think of entertaining such an ambition ? "
" Your ladyship, she has not dared to entertain any such

ambition.

She is a modest girl ; we have brought her up

respectably."

" What do you mean by that ? "
" Your ladyship, she would never dare to do anything
against your will."
Anna Petrovna did not believe her ears. Can it be possible
that this good news is true ?

" You must be aware what my will is. I cannot consent
to such an unnatural and, I may say, disreputable marriage."
" We are sensible of that, your ladyship, and Viérotchka

She said so ; ' I do not dare to offend her

" How could that be ? "

" It happened, your ladyship, that Mikhail Ivanuitch
named his intentions to my wife, and my wife told him that
she could not give him an answer till to-morry mornin', and my
wife and me intended, your ladyship, to call on you and tell
you all about it, because, bein' as it was late, we did not dare
todisturb your ladyship. And when Mikhail Ivanuitch went,
we told Viérotchka, and she said, ' I perfectly agree with
you, pápenka and mámenka, that it is not to be dreamed of. "
" Is she such a sensible and honest girl ? "
" Certainly , your ladyship, she is a virtuous girl."
" Well, I am very glad that we can remain friends with
you. I will pay you for this. I am even now ready to pay

you for this. On the front stairs, where the tailor lives, the
apartment on the second floor is vacant, isn't it ? "
" It will be vacant in three days, your ladyship."
" Take it for yourself. You may spend a hundred rubles

to have it put in order, and I will add to your salary two

After dismissing the manager, Anna Petrovna again summoned Tatiana : " Ask Mikhaïl Ivanuitch to come to me

or, no, it's better, I will go him myself. " She was afraid
that her messenger would tell the news to her son's valet,
and the valet would tell her son what news the manager

brought, and the bouquet would vanish, and not make the
impression on her son's nose as if it were fresh from the
wine of her own words !

Mikhaïl Ivanuitch was lying down, and not without some

he saw in her face a scornful triumph.

She sat down ; she said : " Sit down, Mikhail Ivanuitch,

And she looked at him for a long

time with a smile ; at last she continued : " I am very well
content, Mikhail Ivanuitch ; guess why I am content."
" I do not know what to guess , maman; you are so
strange - "

" You will see that there is nothing strange at all; think

to drag him about the room. The lesson continued for some

That was all that Marya Aleksé-

" Where is Viéra Pavlovna ?

Immediately ! Is it true that she refuses me ? "
The circumstances were so embarrassing that Marya
Alekséyevna could only motion with her hand. The very
same thing happened to Napoleon after the Battle of Water-

loo, when Marshal Grouchy proved to be stupid like Pavel
Konstantinuitch , and La Fayette was bold like Viérotchka ;
Napoleon was fighting, fighting - doing , accomplishing all
the miracles in his art - but it was without avail, and he

could only motion with his hand, and say, " I give it all up ;
let every one do as he pleases, with himself and with me."
" Viéra Pavlovna, do you refuse my hand ? "

" Judge for yourself ; how can I not refuse it ? "

blame ; I am worthy of being hung ; but I cannot bear your
refusal," etc. , etc.

Viérotchka listened to him for several minutes ; finallyit was time to put an end to it - this was hard :

" No , Mikhail Ivanuitch, this is enough ! Stop ! I cannot consent."

" Well, if that must be so, I beg one favor ; you feel
just now too keenly how I offended you ; don't give me
your answer yet ; allow me time to win your forgiveness ! I seem to you low, vile ; but look, maybe I shall
grow to be better ; I will use all my strength to become
a better man; help me ! Don't push me away now ! Give
me time ! I will obey you in everything that you may ask ;
you shall see how humble I am; maybe you will see that
there is some good in me ; only give me time ! "
" I am sorry for you," said Viérotchka ; " I see the
sincerity of your love. " (Viérotchka, this is not love at
all; it is only a mixture of different grades of depravity and
meanness : love is something quite different ; because a man

finds it disagreeable to be refused by a women, that man is
not necessarily in love with her ; that is not love at all ; but
Viérotchka does not know this yet and she is touched.)
" You want me not to give my answer yet- very good ; but
Iwarn you that the postponement will lead to nothing. I
shall never give you any other answer than the one that you
have just received. "
" I shall deserve - I shall deserve another answer ; you

will be my salvation ! " He grasped her hand and began to
kiss it .

Marya Alekséyevna came into the room, and in the stress
of her emotion was going to bless her dear children without
further formality,
that is , without Pavel Konstantinuitch ,

-then to call him, and have them solemnly blessed. Storeshnikof demolished one-half of her joy by explaining to her
that Viéra Pavlovna, although she had not as yet consented,
did not absolutely refuse, but merely postponed the answer.
This was bad; but still it was good compared to what she
had expected.

Storeshnikof went home in triumph. Again the threat
about the estate came upon the scene, and again Anna Petrovna fell in a swoon .

Marya Alekséyevna was absolutely at a loss to know what
to think about Viérotchka. Her daughter spoke as though


======================================================================

A VITAL QUESTION.

she were entirely opposed to her intentions. But the result
proved that her daughter put an end to all the embarrassment, which had seemed too much for Marya Alekséyevna
to manage. If one judged by the course of the affair, then
it would look as though Viérotchka wanted the same thing
that Marya Alekséyevna wanted ; but, as an educated and
wily creature, she elaborates her material in a different way.
But, if this is so, why should she not say to Marya AlekséJevna, " Mátushka, I desire the same thing that you do ; be
at ease " ? or else she must be so angry at her mother, that she
wants to do the very same thing that they are both anxious
to bring about, by herself, without her mother's co-operation.
But her willingness to postpone the answer is perfectly comprehensible to Marya Alekséyevna. She wants to give her
future husband a thoroughly good schooling, so that he should
not dare to breathe without her, and so as to extort Anna

Petrovna's submission. Apparently she is even more cunning than Marya Alekséyevna herself. Whenever Marya
Alekséyevna thought about this, her thoughts brought her to
this view. But her eyes and ears always testified against
it.

And meantime how to act if this view is false, if her

daughter is not really going to marry Storeshnikof ? She is
such a wild creature that it is impossible to know how to

tame her. But, in all probability, the good-for-nothing
Viérka does not want to marry ; such is doubtless the case.
Marya Alekséyevna's common sense was really too strong
to be deceived by her own wily reasoning about Viérotchka
being a cunning intriguer. " But this vile young girl is
managing everything in such a way that, when she does
marry (and the deuce knows what she has in mind ;
maybe this very thing !), at all events, she will evidently be
the complete mistress over her husband and his mother, and
over the whole household ; and so , what is left for her ?

Only to wait and see,

nothing else is possible ! Just now

Viérka does not want to do this ; but she will make up her

mind for the joke of the thing, and she will want it. Well,
besides , we can use moral suasion. Only leave it to time !
But now we must wait till that time shall come ."

Marya Alekséyevna waited. But how charming to her
was the thought, refuted by her common sense, that Viérka
was bringing the affair to a marriage ! Everything but Viérotchka's words and actions corroborated this thought. The
future husband was a " silken one " ; the future husband's

mother struggled about three weeks, but her son defeated
her by using his threat in regard to the estate, and she began
to grow more reasonable.

She expressed the desire to make

Viérotchka's acquaintance. Viérotchka did not go to see
her. At the first moment Marya Alekseyevna thought that
if she were in Viérotchka's place she should have acted more

wisely, that she should have gone ; but on thinking the matter
over, she came to the conclusion that not to go was the wiser
course .. Oh, what a cunning creature ! And, in fact, in a
couple of weeks Anna Petrovna herself called, under the
pretext that she wanted to look at the arrangement of the
new apartment. She was cool and caustically polite. Viérotchka, after listening to two or three of her biting remarks ,
went to her room .

Before she left, it did not occur to Marya

Alekséyevna that it was necessary to leave ; she thought that
it was necessary to answer biting remarks with biting remarks.
But when Viérotchka left, Marya Alekséyevna quickly reasoned, " Yes , that was the best move of all ; let her son pay
her in her own coin, -that's the best way." At the end of
two weeks Anna Petrovna called again , and gave no excuses
for her call. She simply said that she came to make them a

call, and she said nothing sarcastic in Viérotchka's presence .

Time passed on.

The prospective husband made Viéro-

tchka presents ; they were made through Marya Alekséyevna,
and of course remained in her possession, like Anna Petrovna's watch .

However, not all of them remained with her ;

some of the cheapest of them she gave to Viérotchka, saying that they were things that had remained in pawn unredeemed. It was necessary for the prospective husband to
see some of his gifts worn by the bride ! He saw them and
grew more confident that he should get Viérotchka's consent ; otherwise, she would not have accepted his presents .
But why does she put off her answer ? He himself perceived
and Marya Alekséyevna told him -the reason. " She is
waiting till Anna Petrovna gets entirely reconciled." And he,
with redoubled energy, pulled on the line whereto his mother
was hooked, - an occupation that gave him much satisfaction.

Thus Viérotchka was left in peace ; they looked into her
eyes.

This canine deference was detestable to her ; she

tried to be with her mother as little as possible. Her
mother ceased to have the courage to enter her room, and

than books ; and he made some progress , very slow, very
trifling, but all the same he progressed. He began to treat
his mother with more respect than before ; began to prefer

keeping her under the bridle than on the hook.
Thus passed three or four months.

There was a recon-

ciliation, there was peace ; but every day a storm threatened, and Viérotchka's heart was dying within her at the
horrible anticipation, - if not to-day, then to-morrow Mikhail Ivanuitch or Marya Alekséyevna would demand of her
the answer. They will not wait a whole century.

FIRST LOVE, AND LEGAL MARRIAGE .
I.

It is well known how situations like the above would end

in former times : a fine young girl, belonging to a low family,
an insignificant man who is to become her husband under

compulsion , who is detestable to her, who when left to him-

self, being already a mean man, would constantly grow
meaner, but joined to her, comes under her influence , and

little by little begins to resemble a man, of no especial account, to be sure, not very good , but, on the other hand, not

very bad. The girl at first declares that she will not marry
him ; but gradually getting accustomed to having him under
her command , and being convinced that out of two such evils
as such a husband and such a family as her own, the

husband would be the less evil, makes her admirer happy.
At first it is detestable to her when she finds that she can

make her husband happy without loving him ; but her
husband is obedient, - " patience makes love,"

and she

becomes an ordinary fine lady, that is, a women who, excellent naturally, gets reconciled to meanness, and living on
the earth only vegetates (literally , obscures the heaven with
smoke) . Such used to be the way, in old times, with nice
young girls , such used to be the way with nice young men,
all of whom became excellent people, but lived on earth in
such a way as to obscure the heaven. Such used to be the

way in former times, because excellent people were very few ;
the harvest of them, apparently, was so small in old times
that there was not one to a ten-acre lot,¹ and no one can live

a century as a single man or a single woman without fading
away ! And thus they either used to fade away or reconcile
themselves to meanness .

But nowadays it happens more and more frequently that

things take a different turn : respectable people get acquainted with each other. Yes, and how can this help happening more and more often when the number of respectable
people increases with every new year ? And, in time, this
will be a very ordinary occurrence, and, indeed, the time will
come when nothing else will happen, because all people
will be decent. Then it will be very good !
Good it was for Viérotchka also .

Therefore , with her

permission, I will relate to you the story of her life, since,
so far as I know, she is one of the first women whose life

was established in this good way. First occurrences have
a historical interest. The first swallow is regarded with
great interest by the natives of the North .

The occurrences by means of which Viérotchka's life began
to improve were somewhat in this order : It was necessary
to get Viérotchka's little brother ready for the gymnasium.
Her father asked his colleagues if they knew of a cheap
tutor. One of his colleagues recommended to him the medical
student Lopukhóf.

Lopukhóf gave five or six lessons to his new pupil before
he and Viérotchka met.

He used to sit with Feodor in one

room of the apartment, she in another, in her own room.

It was getting time for the examinations at the medical
school, and so he changed the lesson hours from morning till
the evening, because in the morning he had to do his own

studying, and when it came evening, he found the whole
family at tea.

On the sofa were sitting his acquaintances,- the father,
the mother of the pupil ; behind the mother, on a chair, the

pupil was sitting, and somewhat farther, a person whom
he did not know, a tall, well-proportioned young girl ,
rather slender, with black hair ,

" thick , handsome hair ! "

with black eyes
" her eyes are handsome, yes, very
handsome " with the Southern type of face
" as though
she were a Malo-Russian, or rather even a Caucasian type ;
that's nothing , a very handsome face , but somewhat reserved ;
but that's not Southern . Her health is good ; there would
not be as many of us doctors if people were like her. Yes ,

healthy red cheeks and a good broad chest, she'll never make
the acquaintance of the stethoscope.

When she enters so-

ciety she will create a great effect. However, it does not
interest me ."

And she looked up at the tutor as he came in. The student


======================================================================

was no longer young, a man of medium size or possibly
taller than the average, with dark auburn hair, with regular
and even handsome features, with a proud and courageous
expression ; " not bad-looking ; he must be kind, but he's
too solemn."

She did not add to her thoughts the epilogue, “ it does not
interest me , " because it did not occur to her to ask herself

whether she would be interested in him or not. Why should
she be , when Feódor told her so much about him that she

was weary of hearing ? " He is kind, sister, but he is not
sociable. And I told him, sister, that you were a beauty,
and, sister, he said, ' What of that? ' And I told him, sister,
' that everybody falls in love with pretty girls ' ; and he said,
' All stupid people fall in love' ; and I said ' Don't you like
them ? ' and he said, ' I have no time. And, sister, I said to
him , Don't you want to get acquainted with Viérotchka ? '

and he said, ' I have a good many acquaintances beside her. ”
All this Feódor rattled off immediately after the first lesson ,

and afterwards he kept saying much the same thing with
various additions : " And I told him to-day, sister, that
' everybody looks at you whenever you go anywhere,' and,
sister, he said, " Well, that's good ' ; and I said to him, " Don't
you want to see her ? ' and he said, ' I shall have time

enough to see her. " And then again : " I told him, sister,
' what little hands you had,' and, sister, he said, ' You want
to chatter ; haven't you got anything better to chatter
about ? '"

And the tutor learned from Feódor everything that was
worth knowing about his sister ; he tried to stop Feódor's
chattering about family affairs, but how can you stop a nineyear-old child from chattering to you about everything unless
you threaten him ? After he has said five words you succeed
in stopping him, but then it is too late ; because children
begin without any preface, getting the very essence of the
thing ; and among all sorts of disclosures relating to his
family affairs the tutor heard such disjointed sentences as
these : " My sister is going to marry a rich man " ; " and
mámenka says that the bridegroom is a stupid " ; " and how
mámenka flatters him " ; " and mámenka says , ' sister caught
him cute " ; “ and mámenka says , ' I am cute, but Viérotchka

is cuter ' " ; " and mámenka says, ' we are going to fire the
bridegroom's mother out of the house ' " ; and so forth.

other, they had no great desire to become acquainted.

How-

ever, so far, we know only this much : that it was natural on
Viérotchka's part ; she had not reached that stage of development that she had any desire of " defeating savages," or of
" taming such a bear " ; nay, she was still far from it ; she
was glad that she was left in peace ; she was like a crushed
and tortured man, who has the good fortune to fall in such a

way that the broken arm is undisturbed and the pain in the
side is not felt, and who fears to move lest the pain in all his
joints should return .

Why should she care to form new

acquaintances, and especially with young men ?
Yes , such is Viérotchka.

Nu ! but he ?

He is like a

savage, to judge him by Feódor's description, and his head
is full of books and anatomical preparations, such as fill the
soul of a medical student with the keenest delight and furnish
him the richest pabulum. Or perhaps Feódor misrepresented
him?
II .

No , Feódor did not misrepresent him ; Lopukhóf was in
fact a student whose head was full of books

what books

we shall learn from Marya Alekséyevna's bibliographical
investigations - and with anatomical preparations ; for unless
a man fills his head with anatomical preparations, he cannot

become a professor, and that was Lopukhóf's ambition. But,
as we see, if we depend upon Feódor's descriptions of

Viérotchka made for Lopukhóf's benefit, Lopukhóf did not
learn very accurately about her, and for the same reason we
must correct Feódor's description of his teacher if we would
know Lopukhóf better.

As regarded pecuniary matters Lopukhóf belonged to that
very small minority of special medical students who are not
supported by government, and yet who just escape starvation
and freezing . How and in what way the great majority of
them live is known, of course , only to God, not to mortals.
But our story does not intend to deal with people who are in
need of victuals, and therefore it will devote only two or
three words to the period in Lopukhóf's life when he suffered
such hardships .

And it was not very long that he was in such a condition,
only three years, and even less. Before he entered the
medical school he had plenty of food . His father, a meshchanín

(commoner) of the town of Riazan, lived in the style of the
meshchanín , comfortably ; that is, his family had shchi (cabbage soup) and meat not on Sundays only, and even had tea

every day. He was able to keep his son at the gymnasium
after a fashion ; but, after his son reached the age of fifteen, he made it easier for him by doing some teaching .
The father's means were not sufficient for the support of his

son in Petersburg ; however, during the first two years Lopukhóf received from home the sum of thirty-five rubles a year,
and he obtained almost as much more by copying papers as
unattached clerk in one of the districts of the Vuiborgsky
ward. It was only during this time that he was hard up ; and
that was his own fault.

He was accepted as a governmental

scholar, but he managed to quarrel with some one and was
compelled to take to his own fodder.

When he was in the

third class, his affairs began to improve ; the assistant district
supervisor engaged him as a private tutor ; then he found
other pupils , and now for two years he has not been in need ;
for a year and more he has been living in one house, not in
one, but in two different rooms ; and that is proof that he is

not poor. He has for a room-mate another student as lucky
as himself. His name is Kirsánof. They are the closest
friends. Both of them were used from early life to push their
own way, without depending upon others, and in other
respects there was a great resemblance between them ; so
that if one were to meet either of them separately, they would
both seem like people of the same character ; and when they
were seen together, it was observable that though both of
them were very reliable and honest people, Lopukhóf was
rather more reserved, while his chum was more effusive.

So

far, we have seen only Lopukhóf ; Kirsánof will appear later
on. Apart from Kirsánof it may be remarked in regard to
Lopukhóf exactly the same thing that we shall have to remark
about Kirsánof. For instance, Lopukhóf was at the present
time occupied more than with anything else with the question
how to establish his life after his graduation, which would
occur now in a few months , and the same is true of Kirsánof ;
and both had the same plan for the future .

Lopukhóf knew for a certainty that he was going to be a
surgeon in one of the army hospitals of Petersburg, and.
this is looked upon as a great piece of good fortune ; and
that he was going to get a professorship in the medical
school.

He had no desire to practise.


======================================================================

A VITAL QUESTION.

It is a very peculiar thing that during the past ten years
there has appeared among some of the best of the medical
students a resolution not to practise medicine after graduation, though that is the only way by which a medical man

can gain a livelihood ; at the first opportunity they give up
medicine for some of its subsidiary sciences,- physiology ,
chemistry, or something of the sort. And every one of
these young men knows that if they practised until they were
thirty years old, they might gain a reputation ; at thirty-five,
a competency for life ; and at forty-five, wealth.
But they argue in a different way : You see, don't you, that
medicine is in such a state of infancy that one should not as
yet try to cure, but to collect the materials ; so that the

doctors of the future may know how to cure. And here for
the advantage of the well-beloved science - they are great
hands to curse medicine ; but, nevertheless, they are devoting
all their energies for its advantage - they refuse riches , they

refuse pleasure, for the sake of sitting in the hospitals, and
they are making , don't you know, observations that are
interesting to science : they cut up frogs ; they dissect a hun-

dred subjects every year ; and at the first chance they establish chemical laboratories. With what severity they follow
out this lofty resolution depends, of course, on the way in
which their domestic life is established.

If it is not neces-

sary for those dependent upon them, they do not even begin
to practise, and they are willing to live almost in poverty ;
but if their domestic circumstances compel them to do so,
they practise, but only just so long as it is necessary to, for

their family ; that is, on a very limited scale, and they cure
only those people who are really sick, and who can really be
cured by the present pitiful state of the science ; that is, the
sick who bring them no advantage at all. To this class Lopu-

khóf and Kirsánof belonged. They expected to graduate
this year, and they have announced that they will take, or , as
they say at the medical school, “ do," their examinations merely

for the degree of M. D. They have both been hard at work
on their medical theses , and they have made way with ahuge
quantity of frogs ; both have adopted as a specialty the
nervous system, and properly speaking they were working in
co-operation ; but for the formal dissertation the work was
divided : one has gathered for his materials the facts that

they both observed on one question, the other did the same
thing for another .

A VITAL QUESTION.

However, it is now time to speak about Lopukhóf alone.
There was a time when he drank too much; this happened
whenhe was without tea, and sometimes even without boots.

Such circumstances are extremely conducive to drinking,

not only as regards willingness,but also possibility; to buy
drink is cheaper than to buy food and clothes. But this

habit of drinking arose from grief at intolerable poverty,
and nothing more. Now, there was not to be found a man
who led a sterner life, and not in regard to wine alone. In
other days Lopukhóf had a good many love adventures :
once, for example, it happened that he fell in love with a

foreign ballet dancer. What was to be done? He thought
the matter over, and went to call upon her.
"What do you want?"
" I was sent by Count So-and-so with a note." His stu-

dent's uniform was easily mistaken by the servant to be that
of a clerk or some officer's denshchik.

"Give me the note. Will you wait for an answer ? "
"The count told me to wait." The servant returned in
surprise.

" She bade me ask you in."
" Here he is ! here he is !

This is the man who shouts so

loud for me that I can distinguish his voice from the greenroom .

How many times have you been carried off to the

police station for such ademonstration in my honor?"
" Twice ."

" That isn't much.

Well, why are you here?"

" To see you ! "

" Capital ! What else ? "
" I do not know. What would you like ?"
" Well I know what I would like. I would like some
breakfast. You see the things are on the table. Sit down

with me." Another plate was placed on the table. She
laughed at him; he laughed at himself. " He is young, not

bad looking, not stupid, and besides it's a novelty. Why
not have some fun out of him ? "

She fooled him about two

weeks , and then she said, " Get thee hence."

" Well, that is just what I wanted to do, but I did not
know how ."

"Then we will part good friends ?" They gave each
other a parting kiss, and that was the end of it. But this
was some time before, three years ago, and now it is two

years since he has renounced all such follies .


======================================================================

62

A VITAL QUESTION.

Besides his comrades and two or three professors, who
recognized in him a good worker in the cause of science, his
only acquaintances were in the families where he gave lessons ; but he did not know the families at all.

He avoided

familiarity as he would fire, and he held proudly aloof from
all the members of these families, except the little boys and
girls who were his pupils .
III .

AND SO Lopukhóf entered the room, saw the company sitting at the tea-table, and in their number was Viérotchka ;
nu ! of course the company, including also Viérotchka, saw
that the tutor entered the room .

" Please take a seat,"

said Marya Alekséyevna. - Matrióna, bring another glass."
" If it is meant for me, then I thank you. I don't drink tea."
" Matrióna, no matter about the glass. (A well-bred young
man !) - Why shouldn't you drink some ? You ought to
drink some ! "

He looked at Marya Alekséyevna and at Viérotchka willingly, as it were ; and maybe it was really willingly. Maybe he noticed that she slightly shrugged her shoulders.
" And he must have seen that I blushed ! "

" Thank you !

I drink tea only at home."

"After all, he is not such a savage ; he came in, and he
bowed easily and gracefully."

Such was the observation

made at one end of the table.

" After all, if she is a trifle spoiled, then at least she
blushes for her mother's meanness," was the observation at
the other end of the table .

But Feódor soon finished his tea and went to take his les-

son.

The most important result of the evening was that

Marya Alekséyevna formed a most favorable opinion of the
tutor, because she saw that her sugarbowl would, in all
probability , not suffer great loss by changing the hour of
the lessons from morning to evening.
Two days later the teacher again found the family at table,
and again he refused to take tea, and thus he absolutely
calmed Marya Alekséyevna's fears. But this time he saw
at the table a new face, - an officer, upon whom Marya
Alekséyevna was assiduously fawning.
" Ah, the bridegroom ! "

But the bridegroom, owing to the importance of his uni

form and family, felt that it was incumbent upon him not
simply to look at the tutor, but after looking at him, to
measure him from head to foot with the impertinent steady
stare which is adopted in fashionable society. But he had
no sooner taken his measure than he began to feel that the
tutor was likewise taking his measure, and, even worse, was
looking straight into his eyes, and so keenly that instead of
keeping up the stare the bridegroom said :
" Your work must be hard, Monsieur Lopukhóf, -I mean
your medical work."
" Yes, it is ; " and he continues to look him straight in
the eyes.

The bridegroom was conscious that he was fumbling with
his left hand at the three upper buttons of his uniform , but
he did not know the reason .

Nu ! when the awkwardness

gets as far as the buttons , there is no other salvation than

to make haste to drink his tea, and ask Marya Alekséyevna
for some more .

" Your uniform, if I am not mistaken, belong to such and
such a regiment ? "
" Yes, I serve in that regiment," is Mikhail Ivanuitch's
reply.

" Have you been long in the service ? "
" Nine years . "

" Did you begin in that regiment ? "
" I did."

" Have you a company or not ? "

" No, I have none as yet. (He cross-examines me as
though I were a private ! ) "
" Do you expect to get one soon ? "
" Not very soon."
" Hm ! "

The tutor was satisfied, and ceased his examination, though
he still looked straight into the imaginary private's eyes .

"And yet,
and yet," thinks Viérotchka; and what
does she mean by " and yet " ? Finally she makes up her
mind what she means by " and yet." " And yet he conducts himself just as Serge did when he came with the kind
Julie. How is he a savage ? Why does he speak so strangely
about girls ? ' that pretty girls are loved only by stupid people ?' And- and - " (why does she repeat " and " ? At last

she knows !) " and why didn't he want to know anything
about me ? why did he say that it was not interesting ? "


======================================================================

64

A VITAL QUESTION.

" Viérotchka, will you play something on the piano for
Mikhail Ivanuitch and I," said Marya Alekseyevna, when
Viérotchka had set down her second cup.
" Certainly."

" And if you would sing something," adds Mikhail Ivanuitch, in a flattering tone.
..
" Certainly."

" This ' certainly ' sounded as though she had said, ' I am

ready to do anything to get rid of you, " thinks the tutor.
And now he had been sitting down with them fully five minutes ; and though he had not been looking at her, yet he
knows that she has not looked once at the bridegroom, except when she answered him just now. And even now she
looks at him as though she were looking at her father and
mother, - coolly, and without the least trace of affection.
" There must be something quite different from what Feódor

told me. However, more than anything else she must be
in reality a proud, calculating girl, who wants to enter the
upper ten in order to rule and shine. It is disagreeable to
her that she cannot find a better bridegroom for that purpose.
But, despising the bridegroom, she yet accepts his hand because there is no other hand to lead her where she wants to

go. Well, after all, this is rather interesting."
" Feódor, hurry up and finish your tea," remarked the
mother .

" Don't hurry him, Marya Alekséyevna ; I want to listen,
if Viéra Pavlovna will allow me ."

Viérotchka picked up the first music that came to hand,
without looking at what it was, opened it at haphazard, and
began to play mechanically ; no matter, only so as to get
done with it the sooner. But the piece happened to be of a
good order ; it was from an excellent opera, and soon the

girl's playing grew animated.

After she was done she

started to get up.

"But you promised to sing, Viéra Pavlovna ; if I were
there, I would ask you to sing something from Rigoletto."
(This winter " La donna é mobile " was the fashionable
aria.)
" If you like."
Viérotchka sang " La donna é mobile " ; then she got up
and went to her room .

" No, she is not a heartless, cold girl without any soul ;
this is interesting."


======================================================================

A VITAL QUESTION.

65

" Isn't that good ? " asked Mikhail Ivanuitch, in a simple
voice, without this time taking the tutor's measure. (“ There
is no need of being in strained relations with people who
can examine privates. Why not speak without any preten-

tiousness so as not to get his ill will ? ")
" Yes , very good . "

" Do you understand music ? "
" Just a little."

" Are you a musician ? "
" Somewhat."

Marya Alekséyevna overheard this talk, and a happy
thought struck her.

" What do you play on, Dmitri Sergéitch ? " she asked.
" The piano."

" May we ask you to give us a tune ? "
" Very willingly."
He played a certain piece. He played passably- not badly
at all .

After he had finished the lesson, Marya Alekséyevna
came to him and said that they were going to have a little
party the next evening ; that it was her daughter's birthday,
and asked him to come round .

Of course, there is always a dearth of young men, according to the style of all such parties ; but no matter. He
looked closer at the girl with her or about her there is
something interesting .

" I thank you heartily."
But the tutor was mistaken ; Mary Alekséyevna had something more important in view than in finding a partner for
her dancing girls .

Reader, you of course have anticipated that on this evening some explanation would take place ; that Viérotchka
and Lopukhóf will fall in love with each other ?
Of course they will !
IV .

MARYA ALEKSÉYEVNA wanted to give a great party on
Viérotchka's birthday, but Viérotchka begged to have no
guests invited : the one wanted to show off the bridegroom ;
the other found such an exhibition distasteful. They compromised by having the smallest possible party, inviting
only a few of their most intimate friends. They invited


======================================================================

66

A VITAL QUESTION.

Pavel Konstantinuitch's colleagues,- those, of course, who
had been longer in the service and were higher in position
than himself,- two of Marya Alekséyevna's friends, three
young girls who were more intimate with Viérotchka than
any others .

As Lopukhóf looked over the assembling guests, he
noticed that there was no lack of partners (kavalyer) ;
every one of the young girls had a young man, either as
candidate for bridegroom or bridegroom already. Therefore
Lopukhóf was not invited in the capacity of a partner ; why,
then ? As he thought the matter over he remembered that

his playing on the piano preceded his invitation. Of course
he was invited so as to save expense-to take the place of an
accompanist (tapper) . " All right," he thought. "Excuse
me , Marya Alekséyevna," and he went to Pavel Konstantinuitch .

" How now, Pavel Konstantinuitch ; it's time to have a
game of cards. You see it's rather tiresome for us old
people ! "

" What do you want to play ?"
" Anything."

Soon a party was made up, and Lopukhóf sat down to
play. The medical school on Vuiborgskaïa Street is a
classical establishment for card-playing. It is not a rare
occurrence in some of the rooms -that is, in the governmental students' apartments - for a game of cards to be
kept up for a day and ahalf without stopping. It must be
admitted that the sums that change hands at the students'
card-tables are much smaller than those at the English

Club ; but the standard of the gamester's art is much higher .
Even Lopukhóf used to play a great deal in his day; that
is , when he had no money.

" Mesdames , what shall we do ? We must play by cutting
in, that's a fact ; but there'll be only seven of us left.
Either a gentleman or a lady will be lacking for the quadrille ."
The first rubber was drawing to an end, when one of
the girls , the liveliest of all, came flying up to Lopukhóf : " Monsieur Lopukhóf, you must dance."
" On one condition," he said, rising and bowing.
" What ? "

" That you give me the first quadrille."
" Akh ! Bozhe moï ! I am engaged for the first one ! You

are welcome to the next, though."


======================================================================

A VITAL QUESTION.

Lopukhóf again made a profound bow.
tlemen took their turn in cutting in.

67

Two of the gen-

At the third quadrille

Lopukhóf asked Viérotchka. The first she had danced with
Mikhaïl Ivanuitch ; the second he danced with the lively
girl.

Lopukhóf had been watching Viérotchka, and was now
absolutely convinced of the mistake in his former idea of
her being a heartless girl, coolly marrying for money a man
whom she despised. He saw before him an ordinary young
girl, who dances and laughs with her whole soul. Yes, to
Viérotchka's shame be it said that she was an ordinary girl
who loved to dance. At first she set her face firmly against
the party ; but when the party was arranged-small, without
any show, and consequently not a trial to her- even she,
in a way that she would never have believed, forgot her melancholy . At her time of life one does not like to be melancholy ; but liveliness and gayety are so natural that the
least chance of self-forgetfulness brings also, for a time,
forgetfulness of sorrow. Lopukhóf was now inclined in
her favor, but as yet there were a good many things not
clear to him .

He was getting interested in Viérotchka's anomalous
position.

" Monsieur Lopukhóf, I never expected to see you dancing, " she began .

"Why not? Is it so hard to dance ? "
" For most people certainly it is not ; but for you, why yes-of course it is."
"Why for me ? "

" Because I know your secret-yours and Feodor's ; you
despise women ! "
" Feodor did not in the least understand my secret. I
don't despise women, but I avoid them ; and do you know
why? I have a bride, - a very jealous one, - who, in order
to compel me to avoid them, told me their secret."
" You have a bride ? "
"Yes ! "

" How surprising ! A student, and already engaged ! Is
she pretty ? Are you in love with her ? "
" Yes, she is a beauty, and I love her very dearly."
" Is she a brunetka or a blondinka ? "

" I cannot tell you that ; it is a secret ! "
"Well, God be with her, if it is a secret ! But what was


======================================================================

68

A VITAL QUESTION.

the secret about women that she revealed to you that makes
you avoid their society ? "
" She saw that I did not like to be in a melancholy state
of mind, and she whispered in my ear such a secret about
them, that I cannot see a woman without getting into a melancholy mood, and so I avoid women. "
" You cannot see a woman without getting into a melancholy mood ? At all events, you are a master in the art of
making compliments . "
" What else can I say ? To pity is the same thing as being in a melancholy state of mind."
" Do we need pity so much as all that ? "
" Yes ; aren't you a woman ? I have only to repeat to you
your dearest wish, and you will agree with me. It is the
universal desire of all women."

" Do tell me, tell me ! "
" It is this : ' Akh ! how I should like to be a man ! ' I

never met a woman who did not secretly wish this with all
her heart. And in the majority of cases, it is not necessary
to search for it ; it is expressed spontaneously without any
need of drawing it out. If a woman has any trouble whatsoever, you will soon hear something like this : ' We are poor
miserable creatures, we women ! ' or, Men are so different
from women ! ' or even without any circumlocution, ' Akh !
why was I not a man ? ' "
Viérotchka smiled. " True ; every woman has said that."
" And now you see how women are to be pitied ; for if
their dearest wish were to be fulfilled, there would not be any
women in the world ! "

" Yes , it seems as if it were so," said Viérotchka.

" It is exactly the same way ; if the eager desires of every
poor man were fulfilled, there would not be a single poor
man in the world. Don't you see how pitiable women are ?
They are just as much to be pitied as the poor are. Who

likes to see poor people ? Just the same way, it is painful for
me to see women since I have learned their secret.

And it

was revealed to me by my jealous bride on the very day of

our engagement. Till that time I was very fond of being in
the society of women. After that, it was snatched away
from me .

My bride cured me . "

" Your bride must be a kind and sensible young lady ; yes,
we women are pitiable creatures , we are poor," said Viérotchka ; " but who is your bride ? You speak so mysteriously ! "


======================================================================

A VITAL QUESTION.

69

"That is one of my secrets which Feódor does not tell
you. I entirely share the wish of the poor that there should
not be any in existence, and some time this wish is going to

be realized ; sooner or later we shall be able to lay out our
lives in such a way that there'll be no poor ; but- "
" What, no more poor ? " interrupted Viérotchka. “ I myself have thought that the time might come when there would
not be any more poverty ; but how it would come about I
could not tell ; tell me how ! "

" I myself cannot tell this ; only my bride can tell. I am
alone here. I can only say this much : that she is looking
out for that, and she is very strong ; she is stronger than any
one else in the world.

But let us not talk about her, but

about women. I perfectly agree with the wish of the poor
that there should not be any more poor, and my bride is going to bring this about. But I do not agree with the wish of
women that there shouldn't be more women in the world, because this wish cannot be realized ; and I never agree with
what cannot be realized.

But I have a different kind of a

wish : I should like all women to get acquainted with my
bride ; she takes as much care of them as she does of every-

thing else. If they would make friends with her, I should
have no reason to pity them and their wish ' Akh, why wasn't
Iborn a man ! ' would vanish ; for if women get acquainted
with her, then they would not be worse off than men are."
" Monsieur Lopukhóf ! one more quadrille, without fail ! "
" I shall be very much pleased." He pressed her hand
as calmly and gravely as though he were an old friend, or
she his comrade .

" Which one ? "

" The last one ."

" Very well."

Marya Alekséyevna several times passed near them while
they were dancing the quadrille .

What would Marya Alekséyevna have thought had she
heard this conversation ? We who have heard every word of
it from beginning to end, all of us will say that such a conversation during a quadrille is very unnatural.
The last quadrille came.

" We spoke all the time about myself," said Lopukhóf ;
" and that is very bad manners on my part, to be speaking all
the time about myself. Now I want to make up for my impoliteness by speaking about you, Viéra Pavlovna. Did you

know that I had a far worse opinion of you than you did of

me. And now- well, we'll speak about this afterwards.
Now first of all, there is one question that I cannot answer ;
please answer it for me. Will your marriage take place
soon ? "
" Never ! "

" I thought so, for the last three hours, - ever since I left
the card-table to come in here. But why is he considered to
be your bridegroom ? "

Why is he considered to be my bridegroom? why, indeed?
There's one reason I cannot tell you ; it is too hard for me :
but there's another I can . I pity him ; he loves me so !

You will say, ' I must tell him frankly what I think about our
marriage ' ; I did tell him, but he replied, ' Don't speak ; it
kills me ; be silent. "

" That is the second reason ; but the first one which you
find hard to tell me, I can tell you; it's because your position in your family is terrible."
" At the present time it is tolerable. Now no one torments

me ; they are waiting for me to decide and they leave me
almost entirely alone. "
" But this may not last very long ; they will begin to bring
pressure upon you ; what then ? "
" Nothing. I have thought about it and made up my
mind what to do ; I shall not stay here any longer ; I can be
an actress. What an enviable life it is ! Liberty ! Liberty !"
" And applause . "

" Yes ; that's also pleasant, but the main thing is liberty ;
to do what I please ; to live as I please, not asking anybody
for anything, not be dependent on anybody ; that's the way
I want to live ! "

" That is true, that is good !

Now I want to ask you

something : I will find out how this can be done, to whom
application must be made - shall I ? "

" Thank you." Viérotchka pressed his hand. “ Do it very
soon ; I want to tear myself away as quick as I can from this
miserable , intolerable, and degrading situation. I say, ' I
am calm, I can bear it, but is it so in reality ? don't I see
what is done with my good name ? don't I know what all
those who are here think of me ? They say, ' She's a schemer,
she's cunning, she wants to be rich, she wants to get into
fine society, to shine ; she will keep her husband under the
shoe, twist him around her little finger, deceive him.' Don't
I know that they think this about me ? I don't want to live

so, no indeed ! "

Suddenly she fell into deep thought,
"

"Don't laugh because I said, ' I pity him-he loves me so.
" Does he love you ? does he look at you the same way
that I do or not ? has he such a look ?"

" Your eyes are frank, honest. No ; your look does not
‫ود‬

offend me ."

" You see, Viéra Pavlovna, it is because - but no matter.
Does he look so ? "

Viérotchka blushed and made no reply.
" Then he does not love you. That is not love, Viéra
Pavlovna .”

" But -"
stopped .

Viérotchka did not finish her sentence, but

" You were going to say, 'What is it, then, if it is not love? '
Let that go ; but you yourself say that is not love. Whom do
you love best of all? I am not speaking of this kind of
love but of your relations, your friends."
" It seems to me, no one in particular, none of them very
much ; but no, not long ago, I met a very peculiar woman .
She spoke very badly to me, called herself very hard names ;
she forbade me to keep up my acquaintance with her ; we
met in a very extraordinary way ; she said that if ever I
found myself in such need that I was in danger of dying,

then only I might come to her, but not otherwise ; I loved
her very much."
" Would you want her to do anything for you that would
be disagreeable or injurious for her ? "
Viérotchka smiled .

" But how could it be so ? "

" But no ; now imagine that you were very, very much in
need of her help, and that she said to you, ' If I do this for
you, it would torment me,' would you repeat your request,
would you insist on it ? "
" I would sooner die ."

" Now you just told me that you loved her.

But this love

is only feeling, not a passion. And what is love- passion !
and how can you distinguish passion from simple feeling ? by its strength. Consequently, if when one is moved by
simple feeling, which is weak, very weak compared to passion, love places you in such relations to a man that you say,
' I would rather die than be the cause of torment to him.' If

a simple feeling speaks so, what will passion say which is a
thousand-fold stronger? It will say, ' I will sooner die than

do anything for me except what is agreeable to himself; I
would sooner die than admit the possibility of his doing anything for my sake under compulsion or at inconvenience to
himself.' Such a passion, speaking this way, is love. But
passion that speaks otherwise is passion and not love. I am
going home now ; I have told you everything, Viéra Pavlovna. "

Viérotchka pressed his hand. " Au revoir, but why don't
you congratulate me ? to-day is my birthday."
Lopukhóf looked at her. " Maybe, maybe ! if you have
not made this mistake, then I am glad."
V.

" How soon this came, how unexpected," thinks Viérotchka

alone in her room at the close of the evening. " We spoke
for the first time, and yet we became such good friends ; half
an hour before not to know each other, and in an hour's time

to become such good friends, how strange ! "
No ; it is not strange at all, Viérotchka. People like
Lopukhóf have magical words, which attract to them every
abused and persecuted creature. It is their " bride " that
whispers such words into their ears . But here is something

that is indeed strange, Viérotchka,- but not for you and me,
that you are so calm. Here people think that love is an
exciting feeling, and you will fall asleep as gently as a child,
and you will be neither frightened nor disturbed by dreams ;
you may dream of happy childish games, forfeits, tag, or
maybe dances , also gay and unconcerned. It seems strange
to some people, but you do not know that it is strange, and
I know that it is not strange. Agitation in love does not
point to love; agitation in it is something that should not

exist, for love in itself is joyous and unconcerned .
" How strange this is," thinks Viérotchka ; " here I myself,
again and again have thought and felt all that he said about
the poor and about women and how one should love. Where
could I have got my ideas, or was it in the books which I

have read ? No ; there is nothing of the sort there. What
I found in books was either doubts or reservations, and

everything like this seemed extraordinary, incredible, like
ideals that are good but are impossible to be realized;; and
all this seems to me so simple, simpler than anything else,
a perfectly ordinary thing, it cannot help being, it must be

so, surely, more surely than anything else. And I used to
think that those were the best books. Now here is George
Sand- such a good and noble woman ! - and yet, she thinks
that these ideas are only visionary. And our own writers
but no ; our writers have nothing of the kind at all. Or take
Dickens ; he has something of the sort, but it seems as though
he did not hope for it at all, as though he only wished that it
might be, for he is kind-hearted, but he is sure that it cannot
be. But how is it that they don't know that this cannot help

being, that this state of things must actually come about,
that it will be accomplished without fail, that no one will be
poor or unfortunate ? But don't they say this ? No ; they
only feel pity, but they think that in reality things will
remain as they are at present, possibly a trifle better, but not
much. And these thoughts of mine they don't express
them ; if they did. I should have known that kind and sensible people also think so. But here I have been imagining that
it is only I who had such thoughts ; it's because I am a dull

young girl. How absurd to think that besides my stupid self
no one has had such thoughts, that no one else expects this
new order of things. But he says that his ' bride' explains to
every one who loves her that all these things will come about

as it seems to me they will, and she explains it to them so
plainly that all of them have begun to strive to have it realized as soon as possible. What a sensible ' bride ' he has !
but who is she ? I must find out, surely I shall find out !
Yes ; it will be a good thing when there shall be no more
poor ; people won't oppress each other then; all will be joyous,
kind,
and happy
!"
And
hereupon
Viérotchka
fell asleep, and slept soundly,
and saw nothing in her dreams .

No, Viérotchka, it is not strange that you have thought
over and taken all this to heart ; you who are a simplehearted young girl, and have not even heard the names
of those men who have begun to teach this and prove
that this must be so, that this must come about without fail,

that this cannot help being; it is not strange that you have
understood and taken to heart the thoughts which your books
have failed to present plainly to you. Your books were
written by men who were only beginning to learn these ideas
when they were only ideas ; these ideas seemed wonderful
and fascinating and-nothing more. Now, Viérotchka, these
ideas are plainly seen to be realizable ; and other books are


======================================================================

74

A VITAL QUESTION.

written by other people, who find that these ideas are excellent, that there is nothing wonderful in them ; and, Viérotchka, these ideas are floating in the air like a perfume
from the fields in flower-time ; they penetrate everywhere ;
you have heard them even from your tipsy mother, who told
you that it was necessary to live and why it was necessary
to live by deceit and theft ; she wanted to speak against your
ideas , but she herself gave them greater development ; you
heard them from the cynical, ruined French girl, who drags her
lover after her like a chambermaid, does whatever she pleases
with him , yet as soon as she comes to her senses , she finds
that she has no will of her own, that she must please, com-

pel herself - though it is very hard for her - and yet, it
would seem, would it not, that her life with the kind, refined,

and complaisant Sergéi is easy and pleasant ? and yet she
says : " Even for me, bad woman as I am, such relations are
detestable." Nowadays it is not difficult to adopt such ideas
as you have. But others do not take them to heart as you
have. This is good, but there is nothing strange about it. Is
there anything strange in the fact that you want to be free
and happy ?

Now such a desire -God knows what a head-

splitting discovery this is ; God knows what a step forward
it is towards heroism !

But here is something strange, Viérotchka, that there are
some people who have no such desire, who have other desires ,
and it may probably seem strange to such people that on the
first evening of your love, you fell asleep with such thoughts ;
that from the thought of yourself, of your sweetheart, of
your love, you turned to the thoughts that all people must be
happy, and that it is necessary to bring about its accomplishment as soon as possible. And do you not know that it is
strange, and I do know that it is not strange, that it is both
natural and human. " I feel joy and happiness ; consequently,
I want all people to feel joyful and happy." But humanely
speaking, both thoughts are the same. You are a good girl ;
you are not a stupid girl ; but excuse me if I do not find anything wonderful in you ; maybe half the girls whom I have
known and whom I know, and maybe more than half- I have
not counted them ; they are too many to count - are not worse
than you , and some of them are even better. Excuse me.

It seems to Lopukhóf that you are a wonderful girl. So
it is ; but it is not wonderful that it seems to him so , because

he has fallen in love with you ! And there is nothing won

derful in the fact that he loves you ; it is quite possible to
love you ; and if he loves you, then it must seem to him that
you are wonderful.
VI.

DURING the time of the first quadrille Marya Alekséyevna
was continually dogging her daughter and the tutor ; but
during the second quadrille she did not show herself near

them, but was busy in her capacity as hostess in the preparation of the supper.

After her preparations were made she

asked for the tutor, but the tutor was gone.
Two days later the tutor came to give his lesson.

The

samovar ( tea-urn) was placed on the table, and Matrióna
came to call Feodor. While he was giving the boy his lesson,
he was interrupted by Marya Alekséyevna entering the
room . The tutor preferred to remain in his place, because it
was not his custom to drink tea with them, and besides , he

was going to look over Feódor's copy-book ; but Marya
Alekséyevna asked him to come in because she wanted to have
a talk with him ; so he went and sat down at the tea-table .

Marya Alekséyevna began to ask him about Feódor's capacity, about the best gymnasium for him, and whether it
would not be better to place the boy in the gymnasium boarding-house. These questions were very natural, but were they
not made too soon ? During this conversation she so sin-

cerely and politely begged the tutor to take tea with them, that
Lopukhóf concluded to break his rule ; he took the glass.
Viérotchka did not make her appearance for some time. At
last she came in ; she and the tutor bowed to each other as

though there were nothing between them, and Marya Alekséyevna continued to speak about Feodor ; then abruptly she
turned the conversation to the tutor himself.

She asked him

who he was, what he was, what relations he had, whether

they were rich, how he lived, and how he intended to live.
The tutor answered laconically and indefinitely, that he had
relatives, that they lived in the provinces, that they were not
very well-to-do, that he supported himself by giving lessons ,
that he intended to practise medicine in Petersburg ; in a
word, Marya Alekséyevna gained very little information from

what he said. Determining to break through his reserve,
Marya Alekséyevna went at the matter more directly.
"Nowyou say that you intend to practise medicine here, and,
thank God, the city doctors are able to make a living ! Have


======================================================================

76

A VITAL QUESTION.

you thought yet of setting up a family ? - I mean, have you
found a girl yet?"
What does she mean ? The tutor had almost forgotten
about his ideal bride, and he had it on his lips to say, " I
have no one in view as yet" ; but he suddenly remembered.
Akh ! of course she overheard !

It put him into a ridicu-

lous dilemma. What a piece of work I made of it ! Why
did I make up such an allegory when it wasn't in the least
necessary ? Nu vot ! go to ! they say that it's dangerous to
take part in a propaganda ; now here, how my propaganda
influenced Viéra Pavlovna, though her heart is pure and disposed to no ill. Nu ! she must have overheard and understood ; but what business is that of mine ? " Yes , I have a
girl in view ! "

"Are you engaged to her yet ? "
" I am ."

" Are you formally engaged, or is it only a tacit understanding between you ? "
" We are formally engaged."
Poor Marya Alekséyevna ! She had caught the words,
" my bride," " your bride," " I love her very much," " she
is a beauty," and her solicitude lest the tutor were flirting
with her daughter was allayed ; and so during the second
quadrille she was able entirely to put her mind on the care of
preparing the supper. But she wanted to hear the details of

this reassuring story more circumstantially and particularly.
She kept on with her cross-examination. All people like
such reassuring conversation ; at all events it satisfies curi-

osity, and one likes to know everything.

The tutor gave

satisfactory answers, though, according to his wont, they
were very brief.
" Is your bride pretty ? "
" Uncommonly."

" Has she a dowry ? "
" A very large one."
" How large ?"
" Very large ! "
" As much as a hundred thousand ? "
" Much more than that."
" How much more ? "

" There's no use telling that ; it is large enough."
" In cash ? "

" Some of it in money."


======================================================================

A VITAL QUESTION.

77

" Some of it in estates also ? "

" Yes ; there's landed property."
" Soon ? "
" Soon . "

" You mean you are going to be married soon? "
" Yes ."

" That is right, Dmitri Sergéitch ; get married before she
comes into her property, and so get rid of the crowd of men
that'll be after her money."
" Perfectly right. "

" How it is that God sent you such good luck, while other
men have no such luck at all ? "

" It's so ; but almost nobody knows that she is such an
heiress ."

" And you found out ?"
" I did."

" How was it you did ? "
"To tell the truth, Ihad long been on the lookout for such
a chance , and at last I found it. "

" And you haven't made any mistake ? "
" Certainly not ; I've seen the documents."
" Seen 'em yourself ? "
" I. myself.

That was the first step I took."

" Was that the way you set about it ? "
" Of course ; a man who is in his right mind does not take
any risks without proofs ."

" That's true, Dmitri Sergéitch ; no one does. What good
luck ! It must have been in answer to your parents' prayers."
" It must be so ."

Marya Alekséyevna had taken a fancy to the tutor from
the time when she found that he did not drink up her tea. It
was apparent from everything that he was a man of solid
character, with a firm basis of sense ; he had little to say, so much the better, he was not empty-headed, and whatever
he said was to the point, - especially in regard to money ;
but since the evening of the party, she saw that the tutor
was a God-send, on account of his absolute disinclination to
flirt with the girls in the families where he gave lessons . Such

an absolute disinclination can rarely be found among young
men. But now she was at the height of her satisfaction
with him. " Indeed, what a splendid man he is ! And he

had never boasted that he was going to marry a rich bride ;
it was necessary to draw out every word with pincers ! And


======================================================================

78

A VITAL QUESTION.

what keen scent he had ! Apparently, he must have made
up his mind long ago that he would find a rich bride ; and
how he must have flattered her. Nu ! this young man, Imay
say, knows how to manage his affairs. And he set to work by
getting hold of the documents. How sensibly he talks about
it ! he says that no one in his right mind can do such things
without documents. He's a young man of rare good sense. "
Viérotchka could hardly restrain herself from smiling too
frankly ; but gradually it seemed to her-but how did it
seem to her ? No ; it can't be so ! Yes ; it must be ! he must

be speaking, not to Marya Alekseyevna, though he answers
her questions, but to her, Viérotchka ; that he is making fun
of Marya Alekséyevna ; that the seriousness and the truth
which underlies what he says is meant only for her, Viérotchka.

Whether it only seemed so to Viérotchka, or whether it
was really so, who can say ? He knew, and she afterwards
found out. But for the rest of us, perhaps there is no need
of knowing ; for we want only facts. And the fact was that
Viérotchka, as she listened to Lopukhóf, at first smiled, but
afterwards became serious , and imagined that he was speaking, not with Marya Alekséyevna, but with her, not in jest,
but in earnest ; and Marya Alekséyevna, who had taken in
solemn earnest all that Lopukhóf said from the beginning,
turned to Viérotchka, and said :

" Viérotchka, my dear, what's become of your thoughts ? 1
You are acquainted now with Dmitri Sergéitch ; you'd better
ask him to play your accompaniment for you, and give us a
song."

By this she meant to intimate : " We have great respect
for you , Dmitri Sergéitch, and we want you to be a good
friend in our family. And you, Viérotchka, don't be coy to
Dmitri Sergéitch ; I am going to tell Mikhail Ivanuitch that
he's got a bride of his own, and Mikhail Ivanuitch will not
be jealous of him ."

This was what was meant to be understood by Viérotchka
and Dmitri Sergéitch ; he was now in Marya Alekséyevna's
thoughts not the tutor but Dmitri Sergéitch. But for Marya
Alekséyevna herself, these words had a third interpretation
which was very natural and real : " We must flatter him a

little ; his acquaintance may be of some use to us by and by
1 Literally, " Why are you sitting like a buka? " that is, why are you bent over
like the Slavonic letter B? a popular idiom.

when he ts to be rich, the rascal." This was the general
signification of Marya Alekséyevna's word for herself ; but
beside the general signification there was also a special
thought : " When I have flattered him a little, I will tell him
that we are poor people ; that it is hard for me to pay him
a silver ruble a lesson ."

So many different meanings were in Marya Alekséyevna's
words ! Dmitri Sergéitch said that he would finish his lesson first, and then it would give him pleasure to play on the
piano.
VII .

MARYA ALEKSÉYEVNA'S words had many interpretations,
and they were not less fecund in results.

On the side of

the special signification, - that is, as regarded the reduction in the price of the lessons , - Marya Alekséyevna attained greater success than she anticipated : when, after two
more lessons, she insinuated that they were poor people,
Dmitri Sergéitch at first stuck to his price,- stuck to it strenuously ; for a long time he did not yield,-long insisted on
his three paper rubles. (It must be remembered that at this
time the three-ruble note was worth only seventy kopeks.)
Marya Alekséyevna did not expect to beat down his price,
but, contrary to all her expectations, succeeded in reducing
the price to sixty kopeks a lesson. Apparently the special
signification of her words - the hope of beating down the
price- contradicted her high opinion of Dmitri Sergéitch
(not of Lopukhóf, but of Dmitri Sergéitch) as of a man
shrewd in money matters. " What would make a man, who
is a keen financier, give in about money on account of our

poverty ? " And if Dmitri Sergéitch did yield, then, consequently, one would be disappointed in him, and find in him
a short-sighted man, and therefore a man to be avoided. Of
course she would judge that way in the case of a stranger ;

but human beings are so created that it is hard for them to
judge of their own affairs according to the general rule. A
man is extremely apt to make exceptions in his own favor.¹

he knows that in private life Ivanof cheatedhis father five times, and made a very large


======================================================================

À VITAL QUESTIÓN.

What can be done with this peculiarity of the human heart ?
It is bad; it is injurious ; but Marya Alekséyevna was unfortunately not exempted from this fault, which is the almost
universal affliction of the penurious, of the sneaks, and of the
wicked. There is salvation from it in only two extreme and
opposite kinds of moral right. A man may reach such a
lofty plane of transcendental rascality that he becomes the
eighth wonder of the world for his virtuosity in crime, like
Ali Pasha Yaninska, Djezzar Pasha of Syria, Mahomet Ali
of Egypt, all of whom deceived the European diplomats (and
Djezzar deceived Napoleon the Great) as though they were
children . When rascality has enclosed a man around with
such an absolutely impregnable armor, that it is absolutely
impossible to reach any human weakness , ambition, love of
honors, love of command, love of self, or anything else, he
is safe ; but such heroes of rascality are very rare ; you can
scarcely find them in the countries of Europe, where virtu-

osity in wickedness is destroyed by a good many weak points.
Therefore, if they show you a wily fellow, and say, “ This
fellow cannot be deceived by any one," boldly put up ten
rubles against one that you, although not so wily, will mislead this wily fellow, if you only make up you mind to do so ;
and still more boldly put up one hundred rubles against one
that he himself is leading himself by the nose in some direction or other, because it is the most ordinary and characteristic

feature in the wily to be led in some direction or other by the
nose. How artful in all appearance were Louis Philippe and
Metternich, and how nicely they led themselves by the nose
out of Paris and Vienna, into golden and lovely places of
bucolic calmness, and enjoyed the picture of " Makar driving his calves . " 1
And Napoleon the First ! what a wily rascal he was ;
wilier than Louis Philippe and Metternich taken together,
and yet they say that with all his wiliness he had a genial
temper. And thus how masterly he led himself by the nose
to Elba ; nay, he even wanted to go further, and dragged
profit, and in this respect he even excelled Ivan Ivanuitch, who succeeded in cheating

his father only three times; but for all that Ivan Ivanuitch believes that Ivanof is
devoted to him; that is, he does not believe him, but he is grateful to him; and,
although he does not believe him, yet he allows the dust to be thrown in his eyes .
Consequently, he believes , although he does not believe." Which logic is like the
old fallacy: One Greek says that all Greeks lie. If all Greeks lie, then he lies; and
if he lies , all Greeks tell the truth; therefore he must tell the truth. Then it is true
that they lie.

himself by the nose to St. Helena ! How unlikely it seemed
at first, almost impossible ; but he succeeded at last in
overthrowing all the obstacles in the way of reaching the
island of St. Helena. Just read over the history of the
campaign of 1815, and you will see with what energy and
skill he dragged himself by the nose. Alas ! and even Marya
Alekséyevna was not exempted from this injurious tendency !
There are few people for whom the armor against tempta-

tion serves as an absolute protection from the deception of
others. But on the other hand, there are agood many people for whom simple honesty of heart serves as a protection
against such deception. According to the testimony of
Vidocqs and Johnnie Cains, there is nothing harder than to
deceive an honest, sincere man, if he has some common sense

and knowledge of the world. Bright, honest men, who have
their wits about them, are not liable to temptation individually. But they have in one respect a weakness that is injurious : when taken all together they are subject to deception.
A rascal is not able to lead any one of them by the nose,
but the noses of them taken collectively are always ready for

use. But the rascals, whose noses individually are weak,
cannot be led by the nose.

In this consists the whole

mystery of the history of the world.
But to branch off into the history of the world is not
necessary. When you are writing a novel go ahead with
your novel !
The first result of Marya Alekséyevna's words was the
cheapening of the lessons. The second result was that by
getting the tutor cheaper, that is, not the tutor, but Dmitri
Sergéitch, Marya Alekséyevna was still more confirmed in
her good opinion of him as a man of solidity. She even
came to the conviction that conversation with him would be

profitable for Viérotchka; his influence will dispose Viérotchka to marry Mikhaïl Ivanuitch.

This conclusion was

extremely brilliant, and Marya Alekséyevna would probably
not have reached it by her own wit, but she met with such
plain proof that she could not help noticing Dmitri Sergéitch's good influence over Viérotchka. How this was
proved to her we shall soon see.

The third result of Marya Alekséyevna's words was that
Viérotchka and Dmitri Sergéitch began under her encour
agement and permission to spend considerable time together.

After he had finished giving his lessons, towards eight

o'clock, Lopukhóf used to stay for two or three hours
longer at the Rozalskys. He played cards with the mother
of the family and the bridegroom ; he talked with them ;
he played on the piano, and Viérotchka would sing ; or Viérotchka played, and he would listen. Sometimes he spoke
with Viérotchka, and Marya Alekséyevna did not interfere,
was not angry, although, of course, she did not leave them
without her supervision .

Oh, of course, she did not leave them absolutely to themselves ; because, although Dmitri Sergéitch was a very
proper young man, still the proverb does not say in vain,
" Don't hide things carelessly, and you won't lead a thief into
sin . " Dmitri Sergéitch is a thief, there is no doubt about
it ; but it is not said by way of blame, but on the contrary ;
otherwise, there wouldn't be any reason forrespecting him and
making him a friend of the family, would there ? Is there any
sense of making the acquaintance of fools ? Of course it is
well to make the acquaintance of fools sometimes - when you
can take advantage of them. But Dmitri Sergéitch has nothing to his name as yet ; it must be, therefore, that they are
friendly with him only because of his good qualities ; that is ,
for his sense, solidity, prudence, and skill in managing his
own affairs . And if every one has - the deuce knows what
- in his mind, then such a clever man must have more than

others .

Consequently we must look and look at Dmitri

Sergéitch .

And Marya Alekséyevna studied him very industriously

and energetically ; but all her observations only corroborated
her opinion of Dmitri Sergéitch's solidity and good character.

For instance , how can one tell amorous intentions ?

By noticing the way in which a young man looks at a girl.
Here Viérotchka is playing and Dmitri Sergéitch is standing
and listening , and Marya Alekséyevna is watching the direction in which he turns his eyes. But sometimes he does not
even look at Viérotchka ; he looks anywhere else ; or sometimes, when he is looking at her, he looks so innocently,
so indifferently into her face, that it can quickly be seen that
he is looking at her only out of politeness and is thinking
of his bride's dowry. His eyes do not burn like Mikhaïl
Ivanuitch's ! Again, how can the existence of love be detected ? By caressing words. But in this case no caressing
words are heard. and they really speak very little together ;

he talks by preference with Marya Alekséyevna, or, here

for instance, he began to bring Viérotchka books.

Once

Viérotchka went to see a friend, and Mikhail Ivanuitch was

at the Rozalskys' . Marya Alekséyevna took the books that
the tutor brought and handed them to Mikhail Ivanuitch.
" Just look here, Mikhaïl Ivanuitch.

This French I

almost understand by myself. This word gostinaïa [meaning
drawing-room] , of course, it must be a book about manners ,
ain't it ? but the German one I don't understand."

" No , Marya Alekséyevna, that word is not gostinaïα,
but destinée, fate. "
" What kind of a fate ?

Is it a novel that's called so, or

is it a sort of oracle or fortune book."

" We will quickly find out, Marya Alekséyevna, from the
book itself."

Mikhaïl Ivanuitch turned several of the leaves .

" It seems to speak mostly about series and things ; I
guess it is a scientific book ."

"About serious things ? That is good ! "
" No , series ."

" What ! series ? Oh yes, banknotes. Then it's something about managing money ! "

" Yes , that's it, Marya Alekséyevna."
" Nu ! what's the German one ? "

Mikhaïl Ivanuitch read slowly : -

،،، Concerning Religion ; works of Ludwig.' Oh, yes ,
Ludwig the Fourteenth , Marya Alekséyevna ; this is the
work of Louis XIV. He was a French king, Marya Alekséyevna, the father of the king in whose place Napoleon is
reigning now."
" Then it must be a theological work? "
" Yes , I think so."

" That is good, Mikhail Ivanuitch ; yes, indeed, I knew
it ! Dmitri Sergéitch is a reliable young man ; still one
must keep his eyes sharp on any young man."
" Of course he has no bad intentions in his mind, but, for

all that, I am extremely grateful to you, Marya Alekséyevna,
for keeping your eyes open."
" One's got to do so ; I am on the watch, Mikhail Ivanuitch ; it's a mother's duty to keep her daughter straight,
and I pledge you my honor as far as Viérotchka is concerned. But there's one thing occurs to me, Mikhaïl
Ivanuitch. What belief did that French king hold ? "
" Catholic, naturally ! "


======================================================================

84

A VITAL QUESTION.

" Then , don't he try to convert folks into the papistry? "
" I don't think so, Marya Alekséyevna ; if he had been a
Catholic bishop, then, of course, he would have tried to make
converts ; but a king would not spend his time that way.

As a wise ruler and politician he'd simply teach virtue."
" What else ? "

Marya Akekséyevna could not help seeing that Mikhaïl
Ivanuitch, with all his narrow mind, argued the case very skilfully ; but for all that she cleared up the matter with perfect
satisfaction. Two or three days later she suddenly said to
Lopukhóf, while playing with him rather than with Mikhaïl
Ivanuitch : -

" Tell me, Dmitri Sergéitch ; I want to ask you something.
The father of the last French king , the very man in whose

shoes the present Napoleon is reigning, did he make folks
git converted into the religion of the Pope? "
" No, he did not, Marya Alekséyevna. "
" Is the Pope's religion good, Dmitri Sergéitch ? "
"No, it is not, Marya Alekséyevna. I play seven of
diamonds ."

" I just asked out of curiosity, Dmitri Sergéitch, being as
I'm an ignorant woman, and it is interesting to know. You
are taking a good many tricks, Dmitri Sergéitch."
" It can't be helped, Marya Alekséyevna. We are taught
at the medical school to play cards well. A doctor must
know how to take tricks ."

Lopukhóf is puzzled to this day to know why Marya Alekséyevna wanted to know whether Philippe Egalité ordered
folks to be baptized in the religion of the Pope.
Well, how , after all this, could it be wondered at that

Marya Alekséyevna stopped wearying herself by perpetual
supervision ? He keeps his eyes where they should be, his
face has shown no amorous susceptibilities ; he gives her theological books to read ; that ought to be enough. But no,
Marya Alekséyevna was not satisfied ; but she even managed
to put him to a test, as though she had studied the logic
which I have learned by heart, and which says, " the observations of phenomena must be made by means of experiments , carried on in a skilful plan, if one would have the
most thorough penetration into the secrets of such relations " ; and she so managed to bring about this trial, as
though she had read Sakson's grammar, which tells how Hamlet was tempted by Ophelia in the grove.

VIII .

THE TEMPTATION OF HAMLET.

One day at tea, Marya Alekséyevna said that she had a
headache ; after serving the tea, and locking up the sugarbowl she went away and retired. Viéra and Lopukhóf remained sitting in the tea-room, which adjoined the bed-room
where Marya Alekséyevna had gone.
After a few minutes she sent a message by Feodor : " Tell

your sister that their talk keeps me from going to sleep ; let
'em go somewhere else so as not to bother me. Say it
politely, so as not to offend Dmitri Sergéitch ; you see what
good care he takes of you." Feodor went and told what his
mother wanted .

" Let us go to my room, Dmitri Sergéitch ; it is away from
mother's bed-room, and we shall not be disturbed. "

Of course this was what Marya Alekséyevna expected.
At the end of a quarter of an hour she crept in her stocking
feet up to the door of Viérotchka's room.

The door was

ajar; between the door and the jamb was a splendid crack :
Marya Alekséyevna applied her eyes to it and strained her
ears.

This was the sight that she saw : In Viérotchka's rooms were two windows ; between them

stood a writing-table. Viérotchka was sitting near one
window, knitting a woollen chest-protector for her father,
religiously fulfilling Marya Alekséyevna's command. At the
other window, at the other end of the table, Lopukhóf was
sitting : he was leaning with one elbow on the table ; he had
a cigar in his hand; his other hand was thrust in his
pocket ; the distance between Viérotchka and him was not

less than two arshins (4.6 feet) . Viérotchka was looking
most of the time at her knitting ; Lopukhóf was looking

most of the time at his cigar. This was a gratifying state
of things.
The conversation that she overheard was as follows : -

" Is it necessary to look at life in this way? " These
were the first words that Marya Alekséyevna caught.
" Yes , Viéra Pavlovna, it is necessary."

" Then cold, practical people must tell the truth, when
they say that men are governed only by selfish motives ? "


======================================================================

A VITAL QUESTION.

" They tell the truth. What are called the higher feelings , ideal aspirations ; all these in the general course of life
are absolutely nothing in comparison with the inspiration

felt by every one to do things for his own interest. At
bottom, the impulse even for the others is caused by selfishness ."

" Da ! are you, for example, of the same sort? "
" What do you suppose, Viéra Pavlovna ? Just listen and

see what is the essential motive of all my life. The essence
of my life, hitherto, has consisted in study and preparation
to be a doctor. Excellent ! Why did my father send me to
school ? He used constantly to repeat to me : Study, Mitya;
when you have finished your course you will be a tchinovnik ;
you will be able to support me and your mother, and it
will be good for you, too. And that was the reason that I
studied ; without that motive, my father would never have let
me study : you see my family was in need of a wage-winner.
Da ! and I myself, though I am fond of study, would not
have spent time on it, would I, if I had not thought that the
expenditure would have been paid back with interest ? After
I got through school, I urged my father to send me to the
medical academy instead of making me a tchinovnik. How
aid that come about ? Father and I saw that medical men
live much better than civil tchinovniks and the heads of de-

partments, and I could not get any higher rank than that.
And that was why I got the means and went to the medical
school ; it stood for bread and butter.

Without this in view

I should not have gone to the medical school and should not
have stayed in it."
" But you loved to study while you were at school, and
have you not liked medical science ? "

" Yes . It is an ornament, and it is also profitable ; but
success is generally won without this ornament, while
without a motive, never ! Love for science was only a
result arising from a certain state of things ; it was not its

cause ; the cause was just one thing,-self-interest " [vuigoda, profit] .
" Let us suppose that you are right ; yes, you are right !

All actions that I can remember can be explained by selfinterest.

But this theory is cold ! "

" Theory must by necessity be cold.

" But it is merciless ."

" Yes, to fancies that are empty and injurious."
" But it is prosaic."

" Science does not care for a poetical form."
" And so this theory, which I cannot help admitting, brings
people into a cold, merciless, and prosaic life ? "
" No, Viéra Pavlovna ; this theory is cold, but it teaches
aman to bring out the warmth. A match is cold, the matchbox on which you scratch the match is also cold ; but there is
fire in them which gets a man warm food, and warms him
also. This theory is merciless ; but if it is followed, people
will not become the wretched objects of idle charity. The
lancet must not bend ; otherwise it will be necessary to pity
the patient, who will suffer none the less because of your

sympathy. This theory is prosaic, but it reveals true motives of life and poetry in the truth of life. Why is Shakspere the greatest poet ? Because he is true to life, and has
less illusion than other poets ."

" So am I, also, going to be pitiless, Dmitri Sergéitch,"
said Viérotchka, smiling. " Don't be drawn away by the
thought that you have in me an obstinate opponent of your
self-interest theory, and that you have converted me to be a
new disciple. I myself long ago felt the same thing, especially after I read your book and heard it from you. But I
thought that these were my individual ideas, that clever and
scientific men thought otherwise, and so I was in doubt. All
that we used to read was written in a spirit of contrariety ;
it was full of adverse criticisms, of sarcastic attacks upon
what we used to see in ourselves and others. Nature , life ,

reason, lead you one direction ; books drag you the other :
they say, ' This is mean, contemptible.' Do you know, I
myself saw the absurdity of the arguments which I myself
brought up ! "

" Yes, so they were absurd, Viéra Pavlovna. ”

" Well then," said she, laughing , " we are making each
other wonderful compliments. I say to you, You, Dmitri
Sergéitch, please don't lift your nose so high.' You say to

me, You are ridiculous with your doubts, Viéra Pavlovna. "
" At any rate," said he, also laughing, " we have no
selfish interest in making love to each other, and therefore ,
we don't make love."

" All right, Dmitri Sergéitch ; people are egotistical, aren't
they ? You were speaking about yourself, and now I want
to speak about myself."

"A rich man wants to marry me.

I don't like him.

Must I accept his offer ? "

" Consider what is for your best advantage."
" My best advantage ! You know that I am very poor.
On one side is my dislike of the man ; on the other, I should
have the upper hand of him, an enviable position in society,
money, a crowd of worshippers ! "
" Weigh everything ; choose what would be most advantageous."
" And if I choose the husband's wealth and the crowd of

worshippers ? "
" I shall say that you have chosen that which seemed more
correspondent with your interests ."

" And what ought to be said about myself ? "
" If you have acted coolly, after mature deliberation, it
will have to be said that you have done wisely, and probably

you will not be sorry for it."
" But would my choice deserve condemnation ? "
" People who talk all sorts of nonsense will speak about it

as they please ; but people who look upon life from a reasonable standpoint will say that you have done as you ought.
Ifyou have done so, it will show that such was your individuality, that you could not have acted otherwise, circumstances being as they are ; they will say that you have acted
under the necessity of things, that properly speaking you
could not have had any other choice."

" And no condemnation whatever for my actions ? "
" Who has the right to condemn the results of a fact when

the fact itself is in existence ? Your individuality in the
given circumstances is a fact ; your actions are the essential,

unavoidable results of this fact, arising from the nature of
things . You are not responsible for them, and to condemn
them is absurd."

" Well, I see you stick to your theory. And so I shall
not deserve your condemnation, if I accept the rich man's
offer?"

" I should be a fool if I condemned it."

" And so your permission, - I might say, your approval

-I might even say, your direct advice - is to do as I have
said? "

" There is always one thing to advise, - ' reason out what
is for your best ' ; if you do that, you have my approval."
" Thank you. Now the personal case is decided. Let us
return to the first, that is, the general question. We began
by saying that a man acts from necessity ; his actions are
determined by the influences from which they take their rise,
the stronger motives always predominating. Our arguments
went thus : when an action has vital importance, the stimulus
is called self-interest ; its interaction in man is the calculation of self-interests, and therefore aman must always act in

accordance with the motive of self-interest. Do I express
the thread of the thought ? "
" Perfectly. "

" You see what a good pupil I am. Now this private
question about the actions that have an important bearing
upon life is settled. But in the general question there remain
some difficulties yet. Your book says that a man acts from
necessity ; but there are cases when it seems that it depends
upon my will to act in this way or in that. For instance, I
am playing, and I turn the leaves of the music. I turn them
sometimes with my left hand, sometimes with my right hand.
Let us suppose that I have turned them now with the right
hand ; why could I not have done it with my left hand? Does
it not depend upon my own will ? "
" No, Viéra Pavlovna ; when you are turning the leaves ,
not thinking which hand you use, you turn them with the
hand that is most convenient ; there is no will about it.

If

you think, Let me turn them with my right hand,' you then
turn them under the influence of this thought; but this thought
itself was not a matter of your will, but was engendered unavoidably by others."
At this word Marya Alekséyevna ceased to listen. " Nu!
they are spending their time over science ; that ain't in my
line, it ain't necessary either. What a wise, intelligent, and
Imay say noble, young man he is ! What reasonable advice
he gives Viérotchka ! And that shows that he is a learned
man: now here I go and tells her the same things ; she does
not listen, she gets offended ; I can't suit her because I don't
know how to speak scientific enough.

But here when he

speaks scientific, she listens and sees that it is the truth, and
she agrees with it. Da ! it is said not in vain, ' knowledge

is light ; ignorance, darkness.'

If I had been a well-edu-

cated woman, would it have been with me as it is now?

I'd

have got my husband into favor with the generals ; I would
have got a place for him in the department of supplies, or
somewhere else just as good ! Nu ! of course I should have
done the business myself with the contractors ! the idea of his
doing it - rubbish ! I'd have built a much better house than

this. I'dhavebought more than a thousand souls [dushi, serfs ] .
But now I cannot.

It is necessary to get a recommendation

first in the society of generals ; and how can I do that? I
can't speak French, nor any other language of theirs.
They'll say , ' She hain't got any manners ; all she's good for is
to make an uproar on the hay-market ! ' So I am no good !
Ignorance is darkness.' Indeed knowledge is light ; ignorance is darkness . ”

Now it was just this conversation that Marya Alekséyevna

had overheard that brought her to the conviction that Dmitri
Sergéitch's conversation was not only not dangerous for Viérotchka, -she had been inclined to thinkthat before,- but was

even likely to do her good, to lighten her own labors in overcoming Viérotchka's foolish, inexperienced, girlish, thoughts,
and hasten the mystical benediction in the affair with Mikhaïl
Ivanuitch .
IX.

THE relations of Marya Alekséyevna to Lopukhóf resemble
a farce ; Marya Alekséyevna's character is exposed by them
in a ridiculous way. Both these facts are quite against my
will. If I had wanted to preserve a high standard of art, I
should have concealed Marya Alekséyevna's relations to
Lopukhóf, the description of which gives this part of my
story the nature of a vaudeville. To hide them would have
been easy. The essential element of the matter could have
been expressed without them. Would it have been at all
surprising if the tutor, even if he had not entered into this
friendship with Marya Alekséyevna, had found occasion sometimes, though seldom, to say a few words with the daughter
of a family where he is giving lessons ? Does it take many
words to engender love? There was no need of Marya
Alekséyevna putting in a hand to help along this result which
was brought about by the meeting of Viérotchka with Lopukhóf. But I am telling this story, not as it would be necessary if I wanted to win an artistic reputation, but simply in


======================================================================

A VITAL QUESTION.

91

accordance with the facts. As a novelist, I am very sorry
because I have written several pages which are on the low
level of a vaudeville .

My design of relating the case as it was, and not as it
would have been if I had followed my inclinations, also causes
me another unpleasantness.

I am very much dissatisfied be-

cause Marya Alekséyevna is represented in a ridiculous way
with her conceptions of Lopukhóf's bride as he described her,

with her fantastic guessing about the contents of the books
which Lopukhóf gave Viérotchka, with her reasoning about
Philippe Egalité trying to convert folks to the faith of the
Pope, and her ideas of the works written by King Louis XIV.
Every one is liable to error; mistakes may be stupid if aman
judges of matters which are foreign to his experience ; but it
would be unjust to conclude from these stupid blunders made
by Marya Alekséyevna that her disposition to Lopukhóf was
founded entirely on these blunders ; not at all, not for a
moment would any fantastic ideas of a rich bride or the
goodness of Philippe Egalité have obscured her common
sense, if in Lopukhóf's actual words and actions had anything suspicious been noticeable. But in point of fact, he
behaved himself in such a way that, according to Marya
Alekséyevna's opinion, only a man after her own heart could
behave himself ; now here was a brave young man, who did
not allow his eyes to gaze impudently at a very pretty young
girl ; he did not pay her ambiguous attentions, he was always
willing to play cards with Marya Alekséyevna, he never said
that he would rather sit with Viéra Pavlovna, he discussed

matters in a spirit that seemed to Marya Alekséyevna in
accordance with her own spirit ; like her, he said that everything in the world is done for self-interest, that when a cheat
cheats (plut plutuyet) , there is no need of getting excited
and crying out about the principles of honesty which such a
cheat is bound to observe , that a cheat is not a cheat with-

out good reason, that he was made such by his environment,
that not to be a cheat- leaving aside the impossibility of
not being a cheat - would have been stupid, that is, simply
foolish on his part. Yes, Marya Alekséyevna was right,
when she found a resemblance between her and Lopukhóf.
I appreciate how deeply Lopukhóf is compromised in the
eyes of the civilized public by the sympathy shown byMarya
Alekséyevna in his way of thinking. But I do not want to
flatter any one, and I don't conceal this circumstance, though


======================================================================

92

A VITAL QUESTION.

it is so injurious to Lopukhóf's reputation, although I confessed that it was in my power to conceal Lopukhóf's relations with the Rozalsky family. I will say even more ; I
myself will even undertake to explain that he even actually
deserved Marya Alekséyevna's good will.
In point of fact, it appears from the conversation between
Lopukhóť and Viérotchka, that the style of his thinking would
far more easily seem good to people of Mary Alekséyevna's
stamp, than to eloquent partizans of various beautiful ideas.
Lopukhóf saw things in exactly the same light as they appear to the great mass of the human race, with the exception

of the partisans of beautiful ideas. If Marya Alekséyevna
could repeat with satisfaction what she herself had heard of
Lopukhóf's advice to Viérotchka in regard to Storeshnikof's
offer, he likewise would take satisfaction in adding right to
her drunken confession to Viérotchka.

The resemblance

between their conceptions was so striking, that enlightened
and noble novelists , journalists , and other instructors of our

public, would long ago have declared that people of Lopukhóf's stamp differ in no respect from people of Marya

Alekséyevna's stamp. If such enlightened and noble writers
so understand Lopukhóf's stamp, could we really condemn
Marya Alekséyevna because she could find in Lopukhóf
nothing but what our best writers, teachers , and philosophers
find in people of his stamp ?
Of course, if Marya Alekséyevna had known half of what
these writers knew, she would have had sufficient mind to
understand that Lopukhóf is bad company for her. But
aside from the fact that she was an uneducated woman, she

has still another excuse for mistake. Lopukhóf did not give
her the full benefit of his ideas. He was a propagandist, but
not such an one as the lovers of fine ideas who are always

anxious to give Marya Alekséyevnas the benefit of the noble
conceptions by which they themselves are enlightened. He
had enough good sense not to try to straighten a fifty-year-old
tree. They both accepted facts in the same way, and so discussed them. Like a man with a theoretical education , he
could draw from facts such conclusions as were impossible to

Marya Alekséyevna and her similars, who do not know anything beyond personal every-day cares and current aphorisms
ofpopular wisdom,-proverbs, sayings, and the folklore which
is old, archaic, and even stale. But they could never reach
his conclusions. If, for instance, he had begun to explain


======================================================================

A VITAL QUESTION.

93

what he meant by the word " self-interest," which he used
when talking with Viérotchka, Marya Alekséyevna would
have made a grimace, seeing that self-interest, as he understood it , was not the same as self-interest as she understood it; but Lopukhóf did not explain this to Marya
Alekséyevna, and neither was there any explanation of it in

his talk with Viérotchka, because Viérotchka knew the meaning of the word as she had seen it used in those books which
started the conversation.

Of course it is also true that

while saying you are right to Marya Alekséyevna's drunken
"

confession, Lopukhóf would have added to the word " right
(prava) these words : " According to your own confession,
Marya Alekséyevna, the new order of things is much better
than the old, and I have nothing against those who are try-

ing to make the reform and get pleasure out of it ; but as far
as the stupidity of the people is concerned, which you regard
as a hindrance against the new order, then of course I must

agree with you ; but you yourself will not deny, Marya
Alekséyevna, that people soon get educated, and they see that
it is to their advantage to do what before they could not see
any need of doing ; you will also agree that hitherto they
have had no way of learning sense and reason ; but give them
this possibility, and why, of course they will take advantage
of it."

But he never went as far as this in speaking with Marya
Alekséyevna ; and that, too, not from carefulness , though
he was very careful, but simply from the very good reason
of his common sense and politeness, which also prevented him
from talking to her in Latin, and from tiring her ears with
arguments about the latest advances in medicine, though such
subjects were interesting to him. He possessed so much
politeness and delicacy that he would not torment a person
with declamations which are not understood by that person.
Now, while I say all this to justify Marya Alekséyevna's
oversight in not finding out in time what sort of man Lopukhóť really was, I don't say it to justify Lopukhóf himself. To justify Lopukhóf would not be the right thing ; and
why it would not be the right thing you will see as you go
on.
Those who could not justify him, but yet from their
sense of humanity would forgive, could not forgive him. For
instance, they might allege for his excuse that he was a medical man, and was occupied with natural sciences, and that
disposes to a materialistic view.

But such an excuse is very


======================================================================

94

poor. There are very many sciences that lead to such a view,
aren't there ? - mathematical, and historical, and political,
and many others, of all sorts . But are all geometricians, astronomers , all historians, political economists, lawyers, jour-

nalists, and all other scientific people, materialists ? Not by
a long chalk ! Consequently, Lopukóf is not to be excused
for his fault. Those who sympathize with him, but do not
justify him, could also say for his excuse that he is not entirely lacking in praiseworthy characteristics ; he made up his
mind, conscientiously and resolutely, to renounce all material
advantages and honors, so as to work for the benefit of others ,
finding that the pleasure to be derived from such work was
most beneficial for him ; he looked at a girl, who was so beau-

tiful that he fell in love with her, with purer eyes than if she
had been his sister. But in reply to this excuse for his materialism , it must be said that it is universally true that there
is no man so depraved as not to show some signs of good ,
and that materialists , of whatever character, remain materi-

alists still ; and this itself proves decidedly that they are immoral and degraded people, who cannot be excused, because
to excuse them would be to encourage materialism. And
so, while not justifying Lopukhóf, it is also impossible to
excuse him. And to justify him is also not the right thing ;
because the lovers of fine ideas and the defenders of higher
aspirations , who have declared that materialists are low and

immoral people, in these later days have so thoroughly recommended themselves in the matter of sense , and also in the

matter of character, in the eyes of all respectable people ,
whether materialists or not, that to defend anybody from
their censure has become a work of supererogation, and to
pay heed to their words has become even unseemly.
X.

Of course , the main subject of the conversations between

Lopukhóf and Viérotchka was not the question as to which
fashion of ideas should be looked upon as the right one ; but,
as a rule, they spoke with each other very little, and their
long talks , which rarely occurred, touched upon only outside
matters , such as ways of thinking, and kindred topics. They
knew that two very vigilant eyes were on them.

And.con-

sequently , in regard to the main thing that interested them,
they exchanged very few words ; and this was generally at


======================================================================

95

A VITAL QUESTION.

the time when they were getting the music ready for playing
or singing. And this main topic which occupied so small a
place in their infrequent long talks, and even in their brief
snatches of talk, occupied but a small place, this subject
was not their feeling towards each other,- not at all ; they
did not speak a word after the first indefinite words which

were said at their first talk during the party ; they had no
time to speak about it.

In the two or three minutes used

for the exchange of thought, without the fear of being overheard, they had hardly time to speak about the other subject,
which was more important to them than their own thoughts
and feelings ; and this was in regard to the ways and means
by which Viérotchka could escape her terrible situation.
On the morning that followed his first conversation with

her, Lopukhóf took pains to find out how it would be possible for her to become an actress .

He knew that there were

a good many risks and trials standing in the way of a girl
going on the stage ; but he thought that with a firm character
she might succeed all straight. But it proved to be otherwise. When he came to give his lesson, two days later, he
was compelled to say to Viérotchka, “ I advise you to give
up the thought of becoming an actress ."
" Why ? "

" Because it would be much better for you to accept Storeshnikof's offer . "

This ended the talk, which was said while he and Viérotchka

were getting the music - he about to play, and she to sing .
Viérotchka hung her head, and several times lost the beat,
although the piece was very familiar to her.

When the piece

was finished, they began to consult what they should sing
next, and Viérotchka found a chance to say : " It seemed to me that that was the very best, and it's hard

for me to hear that it is impossible. It will be harder to live ,
but still I shall find some way of living ; I will go out as
governess ."

When he was there again two days later, she said : " I could not find any one through whom I could get the
place of governess. Please keep your eyes open for me,

Dmitri Sergéitch; there is no one but you."
" I am sorry I have so few acquaintances who might help
in this way. All the families where I am giving or have

given lessons are poor people, and their acquaintances are
about the same ; but I will do the best I can."


======================================================================

96

A VITAL QUESTION.

" My friend, I am wasting your time ; but what else can
Ido?"

" Viéra Pavlovna, there is no need of speaking about my
time, since I am your friend."
Viérotchka both smiled and blushed.

She herself did not

notice how instead of calling him Dmitri Sergéitch, she
called him 66 my friend. "

Lopukhóf also smiled.

" You

did not mean to say it, Viéra Pavlovna ; take it back if you
are sorry that you gave it to me. "
Viérotchka smiled, " It is too late," and she blushed, " and
I am not sorry" ; and she blushed still more.

" When need comes, you will see that I am a true friend."
They pressed each other's hands.
You have here the two first conversations after that

evening.

Two days later, there was in the " Police Gazette" an
advertisement to this effect : " A girl of good family, speaking French and German, etc., desires a place as governess ;
inquiries can be made of the tchinovnik So-and-So at Kolomna,
NN. street, NN. house ."

Now Lopukhóf was obliged to spend a great deal of his
time in attending to Viérotchka's affairs. Every morning he
had to go for the most part on foot from Vuiborgsky ward
to Kolomna to his friend whose address was given in the
advertisement. It was a long walk ; but he could not find
any other friend who lived near the Vuiborgsky ward. It
was necessary that the friend at whose home inquiries could
be made should be subject to several conditions ,- a respect-

able home, good family circumstances, a respectable appearance. A poor domicile might lead to the offer of unfavorable
conditions as a governess ; without respectability and apparently good family circumstances the girl's recommendation
would not be looked upon favorably. And Lopukhóf could
not place his own address in the advertisement : what would

be thought of a girl who was cared for by no one besides a
student ? And so Lopukhóf had to take an unusual amount
of exercise.

After he had taken the addresses of those who

came to inquire about the governess, he had to continue his
walk still farther ; the tchinovnik told the inquirers that he

was a distant relative of the girl and acted only as agent,
but that she had a nephew who would come the next day and
give further particulars. The nephew instead of going in a
carriage went on foot, looked at the people, and of course, as

a general thing, was dissatisfied with the surroundings ; in
one family they put on too many airs ; in another, the
mother of the family was a good woman, but the father was
a fool (durak) ; and the third, the opposite was true ; and so
on. In some it would be comfortable to live, but the con-

ditions would be impossible for Viérotchka ; either it was
necessary to speak English, but English she does not speak,
or they did not want a governess but a nurse ; or the people
were well enough in their way, but they were themselves
poor, and there was no place in their apartment for a governess, where there were already two grown children, two
little ones , a maid, and a nurse. But the advertisement
continued to appear in the " Police Gazette," and likewise
the governess-seekers and Lopukhóf did not lose hope .

In such a manner two weeks passed by.

On the fifth day

of his hunt, when Lopukhóf had returned from his walk and

was lying down on his sofa, Kirsánof said : " Dmitri, you are getting to be a bad assistant in my
work. You spend all your mornings out, and the larger
part of your afternoons and evenings. You must have got
a good many lessons to give, haven't you ? Can you spare
the time to give them just now ? I want to give up those that
I have ; I have saved up forty rubles or so, and that will be
enough till I graduate. And you have more than I have at least a hundred, haven't you? "
" More ; a hundred and fifty. I have no pupils , though ;
I have given them all up but one ; I have something that I
must attend to. If I accomplish it, you will not be sorry that
I am behind you in the work. "
" What is it ? "

" You see the lesson which I have not given up is in a
wretched family, but there is a nice girl there. She wants to
be a governess, so as to leave the family, and so I am looking
up a place for her. "

" A nice girl ? "
" Yes ."

" Nu , this is good. Look out."
And so the conversation ended.

Ekh ! Messrs. Kirsánof and Lopukhóf, you are learned
men, but you cannot imagine in what respect this is peculiarly good. Let us grant that what you have been talking
about is good. Kirsánof did not think of asking whether
the girl were pretty, and Lopukhóf did not think to say that

she was . Kirsánof did not think to say, " Yes , brother, you
must have fallen in love that you are so energetic in looking
out for this girl." Lopukhóf did not think of saying, " And
I, brother, am very much interested in her " ; or if he thought
it, and did not care to say it, he certainly did not think to
remark for the sake of turning aside suspicion, " Don't
imagine, Aleksandr, that I am in love." Don't you see they
both thought that when there was a chance to free a person
from a bad situation, it made very little difference whether
that person possessed a handsome face or not, even though
the person were a young girl ; but in such a case there could
be no discussion of falling in love or not falling in love.
They did not even think of thinking of it, and what is best
of all, they did not notice that they were doing a noble action.
But, however, doesn't this prove to the sagacious class of
readers (it proves to the majority of literary men, and this
is composed of the most sagacious people) , doesn't it prove,
I say, that Kirsánof and Lopukhóf were cold and deprived
of all æsthetic sense ? This was not so very long ago a
favorite expression among the æsthetic writers who had lofty
ideals . " Esthetic sense" may be even now fashionable ;
I don't know how it is ; I have not seen it used for some

time.

Is it natural that young men, who possess a spark of

taste, or a grain of heart, can fail to be interested in the
face when speaking of a girl ? Of course these people have
no artistic feeling ; that is, æsthetic sense : and according
to the opinion of others, who have learned human nature in

circles which are richer in æsthetic feelings than the company
of our æsthetic literati , young men in such circumstances

will invariably speak about young women from the plastic
side.

Gentlemen, it used to be so, but not now ; it is now

true in certain instances, but not with those young men who
are alone regarded as the present generation. Gentlemen,
this is a peculiar generation.

" My friend, how much trouble this is causing you !
What a waste of time ! How can I repay you? "
" You will repay me, my dear, by not getting vexed. "
Lopukhóf said this, and became confused. Viérotchka
looked at him. No, it was not that he did not finish his
sentence ; he did not intend to add to it, and he is waiting
for her answer .

" What should I be vexed about? What have you done ? "
Lopukhóf became still more confused, and seemed to be
grieved.
" What is the matter, my friend ? "
" To think you did not notice it at all ! "

He spoke so

sorrowfully , and then he laughed so gayly . " Akh , bozhe

" Well, you are a fine fellow ! You came in so radiant
that mámenka looked at you a long time."
" At any rate, I told her why I was happy; I saw that it
was necessary to tell her, and so I said that I have found a
splendid place."

" You horrid, horrid man ! here you keep cautioning me,
and you have not told me, as yet, a single thing. What is

Do tell me at last ! "

" This morning Kirsánof-you know, my dear, that my
chum's name is Kirsánof - "

" I know, you horrid, horrid man, I know ! Now, speak
quick, without any more nonsense. "
" You , yourself, are hindering me, my friend."
“ Akh , bozhe moi ! and all these digressions without ever
once coming to the point. I don't know how I could punish
you. I will get you down on your knees yet ; it cannot be
done here. I command you to get down on your knees in
your room, as soon as you get home, and I want your Kirsánof to look on, and then send me a note, saying that you
were down on your knees. Do you hear what I am going to
do with you ?"
" Very good ; I will get down on my knees ; and now I
shall hold my peace. After I have undergone my punishment and am forgiven, I will speak. "
" I forgive you ; only speak, you horrid man ! "
" Thank you ; you grant forgiveness when you yourself
are to blame. You, yourself, have made all the interruptions."

" Viéra Pavlovna, why do you call me so ? I thought you
were going to call me my friend ? "
" Yes, I meant it as a reproach, my friend ! I am a man
easily offended, and very severe ! "
" A reproach ? How dare you make me reproaches ? I
do not want to hear you ! "
" You don't ? "

" Certainly I don't. What is there for me to hear ? You
have told me everything already, - that the matter will be
arranged, that it will be decided to-morrow ; you see, my
friend, you yourself don't know anything more to-day.
What is there to hear? Good by, my dear (Dō svidánya,

me ! Give me your hand ! See how warmly, warmly , I

" But why are your eyes full of tears ? "
" I thank you, I thank you ! "
" This morning Kirsánof gave me the address of a lady
who made an appointment for me to call on her to-morrow.
I am not personally acquainted with her, but I have heard
much about her from a mutual friend who acted as go-between.
I know her husband though ; we have met at our friend's
many times. Judging from all this, I am sure that one
could get along well in her family ; and when she gave her
address to her friend, she said that she was certain that we

should agree about terms. Consequently, the matter can be
looked upon as almost absolutely settled."
" Akh ! how good it will be ! what joy ! " murmured Viérotchka.

" But I want to have it settled soon , as soon as

possible ! Will you come from her directly to us ? "
" No, my dear ; that would rouse suspicions. I never
come here except during lesson hours .

I'll do this way.

I

will send a letter to Marya Alekséyevna by mail, saying that
I shall not be able to give the lesson on Tuesday, and shall
have to postpone it till Wednesday. If the letter says
Wednesday morning, you will understand that the matter is
arranged ; if it says Wednesday evening, you will know that
it has fallen through. But it is almost certain to read in the
morning. Marya Alekséyevna will tell it to Feodor, and to
you and to Pavel Konstantinuitch. "
" When will the letter get here ? "
" In the evening."

" It's so long ! No, I shall not have enough patience !
And then what shall I learn from the letter? Only yes ,
and then I shall have to wait till Wednesday ! It is torturing. If it is yes, I shall go and call on the lady as soon as
I can.

I shall want to know all about it.

But how can it

be managed? This is the way I'll do; I'll be waiting for
you on the street when you leave that lady's."
" My friend, that would be still more risky than for me to

" No ! perhaps it would be impossible for us to have a

have such a thick veil that no one would recognize me
through it."
" Well, I admit that your plan seems feasible. Let me
think !"

" There's no time to think ! Mámenka may be here any
minute. Where does the lady live ? "
" On Galernaïa Street, near the bridge. "
" What time shall you call on her ? "
" She appointed twelve o'clock. "

"At twelve I shall be sitting on the Konno-Gvardeïsky
Boulevard, on the last bench, and at the end nearest the

bridge. I said that I would wear a thick veil ; but here's a
sign for you : I will carry a roll of music in my hand. If I
am not there on time you will know that I am detained.
But you sit down on that bench and wait. I may be late,
but I shall be there without fail. How well I have planned
it ! How grateful I am to you ! How happy I shall be !
How is your bride, Dmitri Sergéitch ? See, I call you
Dmitri Sergéitch instead of my friend ! How glad, how glad
I am !"

Viérotchka ran to the piano , and began to play.

" My dear ! What a degradation to art ! How ruinous
to your taste to give up operas for galops ! "
" Certainly, certainly ! "
In a few minutes Marya Alekséyevna returned. Dmitri
Sergéitch played two-handed " preference " with her. At first
he won ; then he allowed her to win.

He even lost thirty-

five kopcks . This was the first time, and it filled her with
victorious glory, and when he went away he left her greatly
pleased ; not so much on account of the money as on
account of the victory. There are purely ideal pleasures
even for hearts soiled with materialism, and this is proof
positive, that a materialistic explanation of life is unsatisfactory.

VIÉROTCHKA'S FIRST DREAM.
AND Viérotchka dreamed a dream.

She dreamed that she was locked up in a damp, gloomy
cellar, and suddenly the door opened, and Viérotchka found
herself in a field.

She was running, frolicking, and she

thinks : " How is it that I did not die in the cellar ?

because I had never seen the fields before !

It is

Had I seen

them, I must have died in the cellar." And again she
seemed to be running and frolicking. Then she dreamed
that she was paralyzed, and she said to herself : " How is it
that I have the paralysis ? Old men, old women, have the
paralysis, but young girls never have it ! "
" Oh, yes , they do, very often," an unknown voice seemed

to reply, " and very soon you will be well. Let me only
touch your hand ; you see you are well already ; now get
up!"
" Who was it that spoke ?

How relieved I am ! All the

pain has gone ! "
And Viérotchka got up and began to walk, to run, and
again she is in the field ; again she is running and frolicking,
and she thinks : " How could I have endured the paralysis ?
It was because I was born with paralysis and did not know
how to walk and to run ! Had I known, I could not have
endured it ."

And still she keeps on running and frolicking. And here
comes a young girl across the field. How strange ! her face
and her gait, everything about her, keeps changing, changing constantly. Now she is English, French, now she is
already German , Polish , and now she has become Russian ,

again English , again German, again Russian ; and how is it
that she has only the one face? An English girl does not
look like a French girl, a German girl does not look like a
Russian ; but her face keeps changing, and yet it is the very
same face. What a strange person ! And the expression of
her face is constantly changing : how gentle she is, how angry ; now she is melancholy, now she is gay . She is always
changing, and she is always kind ; how is that? even when
she is angry is she always kind ? But only see what a beauty
she is ! no matter how her face changes, with every change

she grows more and more beautiful. She approaches Viérotchka .

"Ah ! so this is you ! that Viérotchka who fell in love with
me?"

" Yes ; I love you very much ; but who are you ? "
" I am your bridegroom's bride ! "
" What bridegroom ? "
" I do not know. I do not know my own bridegrooms .
They know me , but it is impossible for me to know them , I

have so many ! You must choose one of them as a bridegroom for yourself,- only from among them, from among
my bridegrooms ."
" I have already chosen."
" I do not need to know his name, and I do not know them.

But only choose from among them, from my bridegrooms. I
want my sisters and my bridegrooms to select from amongst
each other. Have you been locked up in a cellar ? Have you
been paralyzed ? "
" I have ."

" Are you free now ? "
" I am ."

" It is I who set you free ; it is I who cured you. Remember, that there are a good many not yet freed ; many not yet
cured.

Free them ; cure them ; will you ? "

" I will ! But what is your name ? I am so anxious to
know ! "

" I have many names; I have various names. According
as it is necessary for any one to call me , an appropriate name

I give ! You may call me Philanthropy [literally, love for
humanity] .

A VITAL QUESTION.

XIII .

LOPUKHÓF during these last weeks has had no time to
spend with his acquaintances of the medical school.

Kir-

sánof, who has kept up his intercourse with them, has replied, when asked about Lopukhóf, that he has had among
other things, some business to attend to ; and one of their
common friends, as we know, gave him the address of a
lady, the lady to whose house Lopukhóf is now going.
" How excellently the matter will be arranged, if all turns
out satisfactorily ," thought Lopukhóf on his way to the lady's
house. " In two years, or certainly in two years and a half,
I shall get a professorship. Then we shall have something
to live on. And meantime, she will be staying quietly at the
B.s', provided only Mrs. B. prove to be the right sort of
woman, and there can hardly be a doubt of that."

In fact, Lopukhóf found in Mrs. B. a clever, kind-hearted
woman, without pretence, though from her husband's position, and from their wealth and connections, she had a right
to put on great style. The conditions were favorable, the
family circumstances very propitious for Viérotchka. Everything proved to be entirely satisfactory, just as Lopukhóf
expected. Mrs. B. also found Lopukhóf's replies in regard
to Viérotchka's character perfectly satisfactory. The affair
was rapidly drawing near a settlement, and after they had
talked half an hour, Mrs. B. said, " If your young aunt
should consent to my terms, I will ask her to remove to my
house, and the sooner, the better for me ."
" She consents ; she has authorized me to consent for her.

But now that we have settled the matter, I must tell you
what would have been wrong for me to tell you before : the

young girl is no relation of mine. She is the daughter of a
tchinovnik at whose house I give lessons .

There is no one

besides me to whom she can confide her troubles .

But I am

an absolute stranger to her ."

" I knew it, Monsieur Lopukhóf. You yourself, Professor
N." (naming the acquaintance through whom her address
had been obtained), " and your chum, who spoke to him
about this matter of yours, know each other to be so honorable that you can speak among yourselves about the friendship one of you has for a young girl, and not compromise the

young girl in the eyes of the others. And Professor N.,


======================================================================

106

A VITAL QUESTION.

having the same good opinion of me, and knowing that I was
looking for a governess , felt that he was in the right to tell

me that the young girl was no relation of yours. Don't blame
him for indiscretion ; he knows me very well. I also am a
person of honor, Monsieur Lopukhóf; and, believe me, I
understand who is worthy of respect.

I have as much faith

in N. as I have in myself ; and N. has as much faith in you
as he has in himself.

But N. did not know her name , and

now it seems to me that I may ask it, seeing that we have
settled the matter, and to-day or to-morrow she may come
into our family."
" Her name is Viéra Pavlovna Rozalskaïa ."

" Now there is another explanation that I owe you. It
may seem strange to you that I, with all my care for my
children, should decide to settle this matter with you without
having seen the one who will come into such close relations

to my children. But I know very well of what sort of people your circle consists. I know that if one of you takes such a
friendly interest in a person, then this person must be a genuine godsend for a mother, who wishes her daughter to grow
up into a truly good woman. Therefore, an examination
seemed to me an entirely unnecessary piece of indelicacy. I
am giving not you, but myself, a compliment ! "
" I am very glad now for Mademoiselle Rozalskaïa ; her
domestic life has been so hard that she felt that she should

be comfortable in any sort of a family.

But I did not dream

of finding such a really excellent career for her as opens for
her in your home . "
" Yes ; N. told me that she leads a miserable life in her
family."
" Very miserable. "

Lopukhóf began to relate all that was necessary for Mrs.
B. to know , so that in conversations with Viérotchka, she

might avoid all references that would remind the young girl
of her past life. Mrs. B. listened with interest ; finally she
pressed Lopukhóf's hand.
" No ; that is enough, Monsieur Lopukhóf, or I shall get
sentimental, and at my age- and I am almost forty- it
would be ridiculous to show that even now I cannot listen

with indifference to tales of family tyranny, from which I suf‫دو‬

you this. Yet it is better to tell you. Just now, she is running away from a lover whom her mother is doing her best
to make her marry."
Mrs. B. was lost in thought. Lopukhóf looked at her and
also began to appear thoughtful : -

" If I am not mistaken, this circumstance does not seem
to you as unimportant as it does to me ! "

Mrs. B. seemed utterly absorbed in thought.
" Excuse me," he continued, seeing that her mind was
entirely distracted. " Excuse me, but I see that this troubles you."

" Yes , it is a very serious matter, Monsieur Lopukhóf .
To leave home against the will of her parents ; that of course

means to bring about a great quarrel. But that, as I told
you, was of no consequence .

If she were running away

merely from their folly and cruelty, the matter could be
arranged with them some way or other ; if worst came to
worst, we could give them some money, and they would be
satisfied .

That's nothing .

But when such a mother forces

a bridegroom on her daughter, it means that the bridegroom
is rich, a very profitable investment . "

" Of course," said Lopukhóf, in a perfectly melancholy
tone of voice .

" Of course , Monsieur Lopukhóf, he's rich ; and it is that
which troubles me . In such a case the mother is not going

to give in so easily. And do you know the law about parents ? In matters of this kind they have full control. They
will begin a lawsuit, and carry it out to the bitter end."
Lopukhóf arose .

" And so it remains for me only to ask you to forget all
that I have told you ."

" No, wait a moment. Allow me at least to justify myself somewhat before you.

Bozhe moï ! how mean I must

seem in your eyes ! That which ought to stir up every honorable person to sympathy and protection ; that very thing
keeps me back. Oh, what pitiable people we are ! "
Indeed, it was sad to look at her. She was not putting it
on. It was really painful to her. For a long time her words
were disjointed, so confused had she become.

Then her

thoughts began to become logical, but, whether disjointed or
logical , they meant nothing to Lopukhóf. Yes , even he was
also confused. He was so occupied with the discovery that
she had made for him that he could not heed her explanation


======================================================================

108

A VITAL QUESTION.

in regard to the discovery. After he had given her sufficient
time to speak out her mind, he said :
"All that you have said in your own excuse is idle. I was
obliged to remain so as not to seem discourteous, lest you
should think that I blamed you or were angry. But I must
confess that I did not listen to what you said .

Oh , if I did

not know that you were right ! And how good it would be
if you were not right ! I would tell her that we could not
agree about the terms , or that you did not satisfy me ! and
that would be the end of it; she and I could hope for some

other way of escape. But now what can I tell her ?"
Mrs. B. shed tears .

" What can I tell her? " repeated Lopukhóf, as he went
down stairs . " What will become of her? What will become of her? " he asked himself as he came out from

Galernaïa Street upon the Konno-Gvardeisky Boulevard.
Of course Mrs. B. was not right in that absolute sense of
the word in which people are right who try to prove to little
children that the moon is not to be seized with the hand.

It

was very possible, nay, even probable, that through her position in society, through her husband's quite important official connections, if she had seriously desired Viérotchka to
live with her, Marya Alekséyevna would not have been able
to tear Viérotchka from her hands, without causing serious

trouble for herself and her husband, who would have to figure as the official defendants in the law-suit, and this she
would have feared. But, nevertheless , Mrs. B. would have

to take a good deal of trouble on her shoulders, and would
possibly have some disagreeable interviews. It would be
necessary in behalf of a stranger to incur obligations to
people whose services it would be better to reserve for one's
own affairs. Who is compelled, and what reasonable man
would want, to act in a different way from Mrs. B. ? We
haven't the slightest right to blame her. Yes, Lopukhóf

was not wrong when he despaired about Viérotchka's escape.

109

" Ah ! there he is ; my friend ! "

She jumped up,

and ran to meet him .

Maybe he would have regained his courage by the time he
had reached the bench ; but he was taken unawares , and his
face was seen sooner than he anticipated, and so he was

caught with a gloomy expression.
" Failure ? "

" A failure, my friend."
" But it seemed to be so certain .

How did it come to be

a failure ? What was the reason, my dear ? "
" Let us go home, my friend ; I will go with you. We'll
talk it over. I will tell you in a few words why it failed :
but now let me think ; I cannot collect my thoughts yet.
We must think up some other plan. Let us not despair ; we
shall find something."

These last words gave him little hope, but not much.

" Tell me right away ; I can't endure to wait.

You say,

' Think up some other plan ' ; then it means that our former

plans are impracticable . Can't I be a governess ? How
poor I am ! how unhappy I am ! "
" Why deceive you ? 'Tis true, you cannot; I wanted to
tell you so. But patience, my dear, patience ! Be brave.
Keep up good heart ; whoever keeps up good heart succeeds ! "

" Akh ! my dear, I keep up good heart, but how hard it
is!"

They walked for a few moments in silence. What is it ?
Why, yes, she is carrying something in her hand under her
cloak !

" My dear, you are carrying something ; here, let me take
it."

" No, no, it's not necessary. It isn't heavy ; it's nothing."
Again they go in silence. They go a long way.
" And to think I did not go to sleep till two o'clock out of
joy, my friend ; and when I went to sleep, what a dream I
had !

It seemed to me as though I were set free from a

stifling cellar, as though I were paralyzed and then cured,
and ran out into the field, and so many young girls ran out
with me, who, like myself, were set free from stifling cellars ,
were cured of paralysis ; and we were so happy, so happy
to run about in the open field ! The dream has not been
realized ; and I did so think that I should not have to go
home again ! "


======================================================================

" My dear, let me carry your bundle for you, since now
I know what it is ."

Again they walk in silence. Long they walk in perfect
silence .

" My dear, you see as that lady and I talked the matter
over, we came to this conclusion : you cannot leave home
without Marya Alekséyevna's consent. 'Tis impossible no, no, take my arm ; I am afraid you are ill ! "
" No, it's nothing ; only it's stifling under this veil." She
drew back the veil. " Now it's all right ; I feel better."
" How pale she is !-No, my dear, don't think about
what I said. I did not express myself well. We'll arrange
everything all right."
" How can we arrange things, my love ? You say this
only so as to console me. Nothing can be done ! "
He has nothing to say. Again they walk in silence.
" How pale, how pale she is !-My dear, there is one
way."

" What way, my pet [milui] ? "
" I will tell you, my dear ; but only when you get a little
calmer. You will have to decide about it deliberately."
" Tell me now !

I cannot get calm until I know."

" No ! now you are too much excited, my dear. Now you
could not decide an important question. In a little while.

Soon ! Here's the front door. Dō svedánya [good by] ,
my dear. As soon as I see that you would give a deliberate
answer, I'll tell you."
" When will that be ? "

" Day after to-morrow, when I give the next lesson."
" Too long ! "

" I will call on purpose to-morrow."
" No, sooner than that ! "
" This evening."

" No, I will not let you go ! Come in with me now.
You say I am not calm ; you say I cannot decide. Very
well, take dinner with us ; you will see that I shall be calm.
After dinner mámenka takes a nap, and we can talk."

" But how can I come in? If we come in together, your
mámenka's suspicions will be awakened again ! "
" Suspicions ! what do I care ? No, my dear, and for this
very reason it would be better for you to come in. We
may have been seen, for I walked with my veil up. "
" You are right."

MARYA ALEKSÉYEVNA was greatly surprised to see her
daughter and Lopukhóf coming in together. She forthwith proceeded to subject them to the keenest inspection .
" I called to tell you, Marya Alekséyevna, that I have an

engagement for day after to-morrow evening, and so I am
going to give the lesson to-morrow instead. Permit me to
sit down. I am very tired and unwell. I should like to
rest."

" Why, what's the matter, Dmitri Sergéitch ? Indeed,
you look very bad ! "
(" Is it a love-scrape, or did they meet by chance ? If it
were a love affair, he'd have been gay. Or can they have
fallen in love and quarrelled, because she would not give in
to his wishes ? Then, of course, he'd have been angry ;
only, if they'd quarrelled, he wouldn't have escorted her.
And then, again, she went straight to her room, she didn't
look at him, and there was no signs of a quarrel. No,
evidently they must have met by chance. But the deuce

" There is nothing special the matter with me, Marya
Alekséyevna ; but Viéra Pavlova looked rather pale, or at
least I thought so."
" What ? Viérotchka ?

She's often so ."

" Well, maybe it only seemed so to me. I must confess
that my head swims, it is so full of thoughts."
" Why, what's the matter, Dmitri Sergéitch ? You ain't
had a fallin' out with you sweetheart, have you ? "
" No, Marya Alekséyevna ; I am content with my sweetheart ! It's her parents that I have to quarrel with."
" What do you mean, bátiushka ? Dmitri Sergéitch , how
is it possible to quarrel with her parents ? I didn't think
that of you , bátiushka ! "

" It can't be helped, Marya Alekséyevna ; it's such a
family. They expect a man to do God knows what things
beyond his power. "
" That's a different thing, Dmitri Sergéitch. You can't
satisfy everybody ; you've got to set limits, that's a fact.
If such is the case, that is, if the quarrel's about money, I
can't blame you."

" Allow me to be rude, Marya Alekséyevna ; I am so

tired that I feel the need of rest in pleasant and estimable

society, and such a society I find nowhere except in your
house.

Permit me to impose myself upon you for dinner

to-day, and permit me to give some orders to your Matrióna.
It seems to me that Denker's wine-cellar is not very far
from here, and his wine is not a God-knows-what kind, but
excellent ."

Marya Alekséyevna's face, which at the first mention of
dinner became black with rage, put off its decided expression
when he spoke of Matrióna, and assumed a look of eagerness.
" We will see, golubtchik ; will you contribute something
towards the dinner ?

Denker - of course he must have

something good."

But the golubtchik, not looking into her face at all, had
already taken out his cigar-case, torn off a piece of paper
from a letter that had seen long service in it, took out his
pencil, and proceeded to write :

" If I may ask you , Marya Alekséyevna, what kind of
wine do you like to drink ? "
" I, bátiushka Dmitri Sergéitch, must tell you the truth :
I know very little about wines, because I scarcely ever
drink ; it ain't a woman's business . "
" It can be easily seen from your face at a glance that

you don't drink. However, be it so, Marya Alekséyevna ;
even young girls drink maraschino; will you permit me to
order it ? "

" What kind of wine is that Dmitri Sergéitch ? "

" Simple ; you might almost say it wasn't wine at all, but
only syrup." He took out a " red note" (ten rubles) .
" There, I guess that'll do ! " He ran over his order at a
glance. " At all events, I'll make it five rubles more."
(" Three weeks' income, a month's support ! But it can't
be done in any other way. It is necessary to give Marya
Alekséyevna a good bribe.")
Marya Alekséyevna's eyes filled with moisture, and involuntarily the sweetest of smiles spread over her face .
" Have you a confectioner near at hand ? I wonder if we
could find a walnut pirog ready made. According to my
taste that's the very best kind of pie, Marya Alekséyevna ;
but if we can't find any, we'll have to put up with the best
we can get."
He went into the kitchen and sent Matrióna to make the
purchases .

A VITAL QUESTION.

" Let's have a regular picnic to-day, Marya Alekséyevna.
I want to drink away my quarrel with those parents. Why
shouldn't we have a picnic, Marya Alekséyevna ? I get
along first rate with my sweetheart. Shan't we live well,
shan't we live happily, Marya Alekséyevna ? "
" Yes indeed, bútiushka Dmitri Sergéitch. That's the
reason [to-to ] ; I see that you are so flush with your money,
which I never expected of you because you are a man of
solid understanding. Evidently you must have had a little
advance from your bride's dowry, ain't that so ? "
" No, Marya Alekséyevna ; but as long as I have money
in my pocket, we may as well picnic. What do you mean
by the little advance on the dowry ? You have to do business in a straightforward way else suspicions'll be aroused.
Besides , it is not high-toned, Marya Alekséyevna."
" It ain't high-toned, Dmitri Sergéitch , that's a fact ; it

ain't high-toned. Accordin' to my idee, one must be hightoned in everything."

" You are right, Marya Alekséyevna."
The half or three-quarters of an hour remaining before
dinner time passed in the most amiable conversation of this

sort, touching on all sorts of noble sentiments. Dmitri
Sergéitch, among other things, declared in a transport of
confidence that his marriage would soon take place.
" And how is it about Viéra Pavlovna's marriage ? "
Marya Alekséyevna is not able to answer because she is
not bringing any pressure upon her daughter. Of course
not, but in his opinion Viéra Pavlovna will soon make up her
mind to marry ; to be sure , she had not told him anything ,
but he had eyes of his own. " You and I, Marya Alekséyevna, are old sparrows , you know ; and we can't be caught
with chaff. Though my years aren't so very many, still I'm

an old sparrow, a tough roll [kalatch] . Isn't that so, Marya
Alekséyevna ?"
" Yes, that's so, bátiushka , a tough roll, a tough roll ! "
In a word, this pleasant, confidential conversation with
Marya Alekséyevna had so enlivened Dmitri Sergéitch that
he forgot all about his melancholy. He was livelier than
Marya Alekséyevna had ever seen him before. ( What a
cute rogue he is ! a clever rascal [shelma] ! He must have
got out of his sweetheart [bride] more than one thousand ;

Bur Viérotchka was sitting in her room.
" Did I do well to make him come in ?

Mámenka looked

so sharply ! And what an awkard position I have put him
in! How can he stay to dinner ? Bozhe moï ! what will become of poor me ?

" He says there's one way. No, my love, there's no way
at all. Yes , there is one way, the window ; when it becomes
absolutely unendurable, I will throw myself out. How foolish I am !

When it becomes unendurable !

How is it now ?

And when you throw yourself out of the window, how quick,

quick you fly, not as though you were falling, but as though
you really had wings ; that must be very delightful. Only
afterwards you strike against the sidewalk- akh ! how
-

terribly it must hurt ! No, I don't believe you'd have time
to feel it ; but- only it must be very hard. But it would
be over in a twinkling ; and then before you struck- how
soft the air is - like a feather cushion - it takes you up so
gently, so tenderly. No, it must be good. Yes, but what
then ! Everybody would be gazing ; one's skull broken,
face torn, in blood, in mud. No, if clean sand could only
be scattered over the spot ; but down there the sand is all

filthy.

No, if it were white and clean, it would be good ;

one's face would not be torn ; it would be clean , and not

disgust people. And in Paris young girls stifle themselves

with coal gas ; that's a good idea, a very good idea : but it
is not good to jump out of the window. The other's a good
way, though. How loud they are talking out there ! What

are they talking about ? No, I can't catch what they are

this is what I told him the other day : ' This is my birthday.'
How forward I was ! How could Ihave been so? But then
I was foolish, and didn't understand.

Yes , how sensible the

poor girls are in Paris ! Well, can't I be just as sensible ?
How strange it will be ! They'll come into the room ; they
won't see anything ; only there'll be a smell of gas, a greenish tint to the air ; they'll be frightened.
What does this
mean? Where is Viérotchka ? Mámenka will scold pápenka : What are you standing there for? Open the window.' They open the window, and see me sitting at my
bureau, my head resting on it, and my face in my hands.
Viérotchka, are you suffocated ? ' I make no reply .
' Viérotchka, why don't you speak ? Akh ! she is suffocated ! ' They'll begin to scream, to weep. Akh ! how strange
it will be ! for them to weep, and for mámenka to begin to tell

how she loved me. Yes , but he will be grieved.

Well, I'll

leave him a note. Yes , I'll think about it, think about it , and
do like the poor girls in Paris ; if I make up my mind, I shall
do it.

I'm not afraid !

And what is there to be afraid of ?

It must be so good ! But I will wait till be has told me what

the plan is that he proposes. But no, there can't be any ; he
only said so to console me. Why do people try to offer consolation ? There's no sense in it at all. Can there be any
consolation when there's no help? He is sensible, and yet
he does just the same. What did he say so for? There's no
sense in it.

But what's he talking about?

He seems to feel

happy. How merry his voice sounds ! Has he really
thought of some plan? No, there can't be any way whatever .
But if he had not thought of something, would he be

so happy ? What can he have thought of? "
XVII .

“ VIÉROTCHKA, come to dinner ! " shouted Marya Alekséyevna.

In fact Pavel Konstantinuitch had returned ; the

pirog was all ready long ago ; it was not the pirog from the
confectioner's, but one that Matrióna had made out of the

stuffed beef that they had the day before.
" Marya Alekséyevna, do you ever take a glass of vodka
before dinner? It's very healthful, especially this kind,
made out of bitter oranges ; I tell you this as a medical

I, as a doctor, prescribe it for you."

" S'pose I'll have to hearken a doctor ; so I'll try half a
glass of it."

" No, Marya Alekséyevna ; half a glass won't do you any
good ."

"And how about yourself, Dmitri Sergéitch ?"
" I'm growing old, Marya Alekséyevna ; I've become
steady.

I swore off . "

" Well, it does kinder warm one through."
" That's where the good comes in, Marya Alekséyevna ; it
gives you new warmth."
(" How gay he is ! Is there really something in prospect ?
And how on earth did he manage to become so friendly with
her ? And he does not even look at me.

Akh ! how shrewd

he is ! ")
They sat down to table .
" Now, here we must drink a health to Pavel Konstan-

tinuitch. Let us drink it with this. Ale - it's just the
same thing as beer, not any stronger than beer. Try it,
Marya Alekséyevna. "
" If, as you say, it's beer, why, there's no reason not to
drink beer."

(" Gospodi (Heavens) ! what a lot of bottles ! Akh ! how
silly I am. That's the way she got to be so friendly ! ")
(" What a cunning rascal he is ! He himself don't drink.
He only touches his ale with his lips ! But what excellent
ale ! It tastes better nor kvas, and it's strong ; its got a
very good strength. When I get her married off to Mishka,
I'll give up vodka and drink nothing but ale. Nu! this
fellow'll never loose his head in drink ! If he'd only give in
to it, the villain ! But then, it's for my advantage ! I
reckon if he wanted to drink tea, he'd drink enough !)
You'd ought to drink some yourself, Dmitri Sergéitch."
" Eh ! in my day we used to drink a good deal, Marya
Alekséyevna. I drank enough to last a long time. When
I had no luck, and no money, I used to get drunk ; but now
I have enough to do, and enough money, I don't need wine ;
I feel gay enough without it."
And so the entire dinner passed off. They bring on the
confectioner's pirog.

" My dear Matrióna Stepanóvna, what goes well with
this ?"

" I'll bring it right in, Dmitri Sergéitch;" and Matrióna

" May God grant your bride and Viérotchka's I ridegroom

" Never you fear ; you won't have long to wait, Marya

" Does he really mean what he says ? " thinks Viérotchka.
" Certainly [da] ! Viéra Pavlovna ; of course she means
to marry him ! Just say ' yes .'"
" Yes ," says Viérotchka.

And now we must drink another toast to Viéra

Pavlovna's approaching wedding.

Drink it, Viéra Pav-

They clink glasses .
"God grant it ! God grant it ! [daï Bog ! daï Bog !]
Thank you , Viérotchka ; you make happy, Viérotchka, in
my old age," says Marya Alekséyevna, wiping away her
tears. The English ale and the maraschino had brought
her into a sentimental state of mind.

“ Daï Bog ! daï Bog ! " echoed Pavel Konstantinuitch .
" How pleased we are with you , Dmitri Sergéitch," says
Marya Alekséyevna after dinner was over ; " yes, indeed we
are pleased. You have been our guest and yet you have
treated us ! Well, we can well say that you have given us a
holiday's entertainment ! " Her eyes had a far pleasanter
expression than the impudent one that they generally wore.
Not everything results as cleverly as it is cleverly planned.
Lopukhóf had not dared to hope for such a result when he
bought the wine ; he only intended to give Marya Alekséyevna a bribe, so that he might not lose her good will by
having invited himself to stay to dinner. Would she have
drunk so much before a stranger, even though they had common sympathies, unless she trusted him ? But is there any

one whom she would trust !

And in fact she herself had not

intended to yield so soon to the temptation. She meant to
postpone her main share in the enjoyment of the good things
till after tea. But every human being has his weakness ;
she could have withstood the vodka and other familiar

drinks , but ale and other attractions of the sort led her

astray through inexperience.
The dinner passed off in very formal and baronial style ,
and therefore Marya Alekséyevna ordered Matrióna to set on
the samovar, as is customary after baronial dinners . But only
she herself and Lopukhóf availed themselves of this luxury.
Viérotchka declared that she didn't want any tea, and she
went right to her room.

Pavel Konstantinuitch, like an

ignorant boor, went off to take his nap, as he always did
after dinner. Dimtri Sergéitch drank deliberately, and

when he had finished one cup, he asked for another. Here
Marya Alekséyevna began to feel a bit queer ; she excused
herself by saying that she had not been well since early
morning ; the guest begged her not to stand on ceremony
and she left him to himself. He drank a second cup and a
third, and took a nap in his chair ; must have dozed some

time, " like our golden one [zoloto] , " as Matrióna expressed ;
and the golden one was already snoring. It must have been
her snoring that wakened Dmitri Sergéitch , after Matrióna
went into the kitchen for good and all, taking with her the
samovar and the cups .
XVIII .

" FORGIVE me, Viéra Pavlovna," said Lopukhóf, coming
into her room . How gently he speaks , and his voice trem-

bles ; but at dinner he spoke loud, and he did not call her
my dear, but Viéra Pavlovna. " Forgive me for having
been impertinent. You know what I said : yes , a husband and wife cannot be separated. Then you are free."
He took her hand and kissed it.

" My dearest, you saw that I wept when you came in ; it
was out of joy."
Lopukhóf kissed her hand; many times he kissed her
hand.

" Here, my dearest, you are freeing me from the cellar ;
how clever and kind you are. How did you happen to think
about it ? "


======================================================================

" It was when we first danced together, that I thought
about it ."

" My dearest, I thought then that you were kind. You
are giving me liberty, my dearest. Now I am ready to suffer, now I know that I am leaving the cellar ; now it will
not be so suffocating for me, now I know that I am already
leaving it ; but how shall I leave it, my dearest ?"
" This is the way, Viérotchka. It is now the end of April.
At the beginning of July my work at the medical school will
be over. I must graduate, so that we can have the means
to live, and then you shall leave your cellar. Endure it only
three months, or even less ; you shall get out. I shall have
the position of surgeon. The salary is not over large ; but
no matter, I shall have some practice ; as much as will be
necessary, and we shall get along."
" Akh ! my dearest, we shall need but very little. But I
do not want it to be so ; I do not want to live at your ex-

pense. You see I am earning something now by giving lessons ; but I shall lose them then, for mámenka will tell everybody that I am an abomination. But I shall find other
pupils. I shall begin to live. Now isn't that the right way ?
Don't you see that I mustn't live at your expense ? "

" Who gave you that idea, my dearest friend, Viérotchka ? "

"Akh ! and now he is asking me who gave me that idea.
Why, weren't you yourself always saying this very thing ?
And in your books fully half of them say so ! "
" In the books ? Did I say so ? When was it, Viérotchka ? "

" Akh ! when was it indeed ! and who told me that money

lay at the root of all things ? Who told me that, Dmitri
Sergéitch ? "
" Well, what of that ? "

" And you think that I am such a foolish young girl that
I cannot draw a conclusion from premises, to use the words
of your books ? "

" Well, what conclusions ? My dearest friend, Viérotchka,
you are talking God-knows- what nonsense."
"Akh ! smarty ! he wants to be a despot ; he wants me
to become his slave ! no indeed, this cannot be. Dmitri
Sergéitch, do you understand ? "
" Then you tell me, and I shall understand."

" Money lies at the root of all things, you say, Dmitri

Sergéitch ; whoever has the money has the might and the

did not understand it ; that I was going to be your slave.

You will cut off people's hands and legs, you will

make them drink miserable mixtures, and I will give pianolessons .

And how else should we live ? "

" That's right, that's right. Let every one preserve his
independence from everybody with all his might, no matter
how he loves him, how he trusts him ! Whether you will
carry out what you propose or not, I do not know ; but it
makes very little difference : whoever makes up his mind to
do a thing of this sort has already built his fort ; he already
feels that he can get along by himself ; that he can refuse the
help of others , if necessary, and this feeling is almost
enough of itself. What queer people we are, Viérotchka !
You say, ' I do not want to live at your expense,' and I am
praising you for it ! Who else says such things, Viérotchka ? "
" No matter if we are queer, my milenki ; what do we
care ? We shall live according to our own style ; it is better
for us .

How else should we live, mílenki ? "

" Viéra Pavlovna, I have proposed to you my ideas about
one side of our life ; you have condescended to overthrow
them altogether with your plan. You have called me a

tyrant and a slave-holder ; now be kind enough to think
yourself how the other parts of our relations shall be arranged. I count it idle to give you the benefit of my
thoughts , lest they should be destroyed by you in the same
way. My friend, Viérotchka, tell me yourself how we ought
to live ; in all probability, there will be nothing left for me
to say but this, ' My dear [móya milia] , how very wise your
ideas are ! " "

" What is that ?

Do you mean to give me a compliment ?

You want to be very polite ; but I know too well how people
flatter so as to reign under a mask of humility. I beg of
you to speak more simply hereafter. My dear [milui moї] ,
you are praising me to death. I am ashamed, my dear ;
don't praise me, lest I become too proud."

A VITAL QUESTION.

" Very good, Viéra Pavlovna; I will begin to say rough
things to you if you like that better. There is so little
femininity in your nature, Viéra Pavlovna, that most likely
you have nothing but men's thoughts."
" Akh ! mydearest, what does that word ' femininity ' mean ?
I understand that a woman speaks in a contralto voice, — а

man, in a baritone ; but what of that? Is it worth while to
bother about our contralto voices ?

Is it worth while to ask

us about such things ? Why do people keep telling us that
it is our duty to remain feminine ? Isn't it a piece of nonsense, dear ? "

" It is nonsense, Viérotchka, and a very great piece of
triviality."

" So, then, my dear, I shall not bother myself about femininity ; now listen, Dmitri Sergéitch, I am going to express
in absolutely masculine fashion the way that I think we ought
to live. We shall be friends ; only I wish to be your principal friend. Akh ! I have never told you how I dislike this
dear Kirsánof of yours ! "
" You must not, Viérotchka ; he is a very fine man ! "
" But I hate him ! I shall forbid your seeing him ! "
" That is a fine beginning ! She is so afraid of my despotism that she wants to make a doll of her husband.

And

how can I help seeing him when we live together ? "
" You are always sitting together like lovers ! "
" Of course .

At breakfast and at dinner.

When one's

hands are always occupied, it is hard to use them like lovers'
hands ."

" And you are always inseparable ! "

" Most likely. He is in his room and I in mine ; that
means almost inseparable. "

"And if that is so, why shouldn't you stop seeing him
altogether ? "

" Well [da] , we are friends ; sometimes we want to talk,
and we talk, and so far we haven't been burdensome to each
other ."

" You are always sitting together, hugging and disputing.
I hate him . "

" What makes you think so, Viérotchka ? We have never
quarrelled. We live almost separately ; we are friends, to
be sure ; but what of that ? "

" Akh ! my dearest, how I deceived you, how cleverly I deceived you. You did not want to tell me how we should live

together, and yet you have told me everything ! How I deceived you ! Listen : this is the way we should live according to your idea. In the first place, we shall have two rooms ,
yours and mine, and then a third room where we shall drink
tea, take dinner, receive guests who come to call on both of
us ! and not on you alone, and not on me alone. In the

second place, I must not dare to enter your room lest I
bother you . You see Kirsánof does not dare to interrupt
you, and so you do not quarrel with him. And it will be the
same with mine. That is the second.

Now there is a third !

Akh ! my dearest, I forget to ask you about it.

Does Kir-

sánof interfere with your affairs, or you with his ? Have you
a right to ask each other about anything ? "
" Eh ! now I see why you mention Kirsánof ; I shall not
tell you !"
" No ! but I dislike him for all this ; and you need not tell
me, for it's not necessary. I myself know. You have no
right to ask each other about anything. And so, in the third
place, I shall have no right to ask you about anything , my
dear. If it is necessary for you to tell me about any of your
affairs , you will tell me yourself, and vice versa. Here are
three rules .

What more more is there ? "

" Viérotchka, your second rule demands explanations. We
shall see each other at tea or dinner in our neutral room.

Now imagine such an occasion as this : We have drunk our

tea in the morning, I am sitting in my room, and do not dare
to show my nose in yours ; consequently, I cannot see you
till dinner time ; isn't that so ? "
" Of course."

" Excellent ! An acquaintance of mine comes and says ,
that at two o'clock another acquintance will call on me, but

it happens my business calls me away at one. May I ask
you to tell that acquaintance who is coming at two the proper
answer ? may I ask you whether you intend to remain at
home ?"

" Of course you may.

Whether I will undertake it is an-

other question ! If I refuse, you have no right to claim it of
me ; you have no right to even ask why I refuse. But to ask
whether I will consent to do you that little service-you shall
have that right."
" Excellent !

But at breakfast I did not know that he was

coming, and I shall not dare to enter your room ; how then
can I ask the question ? "

123

" O bozhe ! how simple he is ! a little child ! Just listen
to him ! How he misunderstands me ! This is the way
you must do, Dmitri Sergéitch. You shall enter the neutral
room and say, ' Viéra Pavlovna ! ' I shall answer from my
room, What do you want, Dmitri Sergéitch.' You will re-

ply, ' I am going out. In my absence Mr. A. will call (of
course you will give me your friend's name) ; I have some
news to tell him ; may I ask you, Viéra Pavlovna, to tell him
that ? '

If I answer'no ' our conversation is at an end ; but

if I say ' yes ' I shall come out into the neutral room, and you
shall tell me what you want me to tell your friend. Now,
my dear little child, you know, don't you, how it will be
necessary to act ? "

" Yes, my dear Viérotchka, jesting aside, it is much better
to live in the way that you propose. Only, who in the world
put such ideas into your head? I know them, and I remember where I have read of such things ; but such books never
come into your hands. In the books which I let you have

there were no such ideas. Did you hear them ? from whom ?
I was almost the first person whom you ever met from among
respectable people."

" Akh ! my dear, is it so very hard to think out such
things ? I have seen family life, I am not speaking about
my family ; my family is so peculiar, - but I have friends, and
I have been in their homes. Bozhe moï ! what disagreeable
scenes between husbands and wives ; you cannot imagine
them, my dear ! "
" Nu ! I have no trouble in imagining them, Viérotchka."
" Do you know how it seems to me, my dear? People
ought not to live the way they do : always together, always
together ! They ought not to see each other except on business, or when they come together to rest or have a good
time. I am always looking and thinking, why is everybody
so polite to strangers ? Why do all people try to appear bet-

ter than they are in their own families? And in fact, before
strangers they are better. Why is it ? Why do they treat
their own people worse than they do strangers, though they
love them more ? Do you know, my dear, that there is one
favor that I want to ask of you , to treat me as you have
always treated me. This has not hindered you from loving
me ; after all, you and I have been nearer to each other than

all the rest . How have you always acted towards me ? Have
you ever answered rudely ? have you ever spoken unkindly ?


======================================================================

Never !

A VITAL QUESTION.

People ask how it is possible to be rude to a

woman or a girl who is a stranger ; how is it possible to
speak harshly to her ? So far, so good, my dear ; now I ar
your bride ; I am going to be your wife, but you must always
treat me as they say it is right to treat a stranger : this , my

dear, seems to be better than all else for preserving harmony, for preserving love. So, my dear ! "
" I don't know what to think of you, Viérotchka. This is
not the first time that you have surprised me."
" My dear [mílenki moï] , you want to flatter me to death.
No, my friend, it is not as difficult to understand as it may
seem to you. Such thoughts are not peculiar to me alone,
my dear ; they are held by a good many girls and young
women, even such simpletons as I am. Only it is impossible
for them to tell their bridegrooms or their husbands what
they think ; they know that if they did, it would be said
that they were immoral. I fell in love with you, my dear,
because you don't think so. Do you know when I began to
love you ? It was when we talked together the first time,
my birthday ; when you said that women were poor, and to
be pitied : it was then that I fell in love with you."
" And when did I fall in love with you ? That very same
day? Do you suppose it was on that very same day when I
told you that ? "

" How strange you are, dearest [mílenki] ! You said that
I couldn't guess ; but if I should guess, you would begin to
praise me again."

" But try to guess for all that ! "
" Well, of course it was when I asked whether it was not

possible to arrange things so that all people could live comfortably."

" I must kiss your hand again in payment for that, Viérotchka ."

" That'll do, my dear ; I do not like the habit of kissing
women's hands ."

" Why not, Viérotchka ? "
" Akh ! my dear, you yourself know why. What is the
good of asking me ? Don't ask such questions, my milenki ! "
" Yes , my friend, that is true ; one should not ask such
questions : it is wrong. I'll ask you only when I do not
really know what you mean ; and you meant that nobody's
hand should be kissed . "

Viérotchka laughed heartily.


======================================================================

A VITAL

QUESTION.

125

" Now I forgive you, because I have succeeded in laughing at you. You see, you wanted to examine me, and you
yourself did not know the principal reason why it is not
well. Nobody's hands should be kissed ; that's true : but
that was not what I was talking about ; not the general rule,
but only about the impropriety of a man kissing a woman's
hand. This , my dear, ought to be very offensive to a
woman ; it shows that she is not looked upon as an equal.

Women think that a man cannot lower self-respect before a
woman ; that she is already so much lower than he is, that
no matter how much he lowers himself before her, still he

does not come down to her level, but is far higher than she
is. But you do not think this way, my dear ; why, then
should you kiss my hand. But listen to what I think, my
milenki, as though we had never been bridegroom and
bride."

" Yes, that is true, Viérotchka ; it looks very little like it.
But what are we then ? "

" God knows what we are, my milenki; or rather it's this
way : as though we had been married, long, long ago."
" That's so, my dear, it is true ; we are old friends, nothing has changed ."

" Only one thing has changed, my milenki : that now I
know that I am coming out from the cellar to enjoy freedom."
XIX .

THUS they talked, - rather a strange conversation for the
first one after their engagement, - and they pressed each

other's hands, and Lopukhóf went home by himself, and Viérotchka locked the door after him, because Matrióna re-

mained sitting longer than usual in the dining-room, hoping
that her " golden one " would snore for a long time to come ;
and, in fact, her golden one did snore for a long time to
come.

When Lopukhóf reached home about seven o'clock he

tried to apply himself to work, but he could not collect his
thoughts . His mind was occupied not with his work, but he
was constantly occupied with the same visions that came to
him during the lone walk from the Semyonovsky bridge to
the Vuiborgsky ward : naturally with visions of love. Certainly with such visions, but yet not entirely with love and
not entirely with visions. The life of a man without means

has its prosaic interests, and it was about them that Lopukhóf was also thinking : that is to be taken for granted. He
is a materialist, and therefore he thinks only about his interests , and in point of fact, he was all the time thinking about

his own interests. Instead of lofty, poetical, and plastic
imaginations , such love imaginations as are proper for a
coarse materialist occupied his time.

" A sacrifice -, it will be almost impossible to get this out
of her head, and this is bad. When you think that you are

specially indebted to a person, your relations to this person
are apt to be somewhat strained, and she may find this out.
Friends may explain to her what a career was before me ; and
even if friends do not explain this to her, she will find it out

for herself. She will say, ' My dear, here you have given up
for my sake the career which you anticipated.' Well, I don't
mean money, for neither my friends nor she herself will
think that I care about that. Well, it's a good thing that
she will not say to herself, He remained for my sake in poverty when otherwise he might have been rich.' This she will
not think ; but she may learn that I longed for scientific
fame, and that I might have won it. But she will find something to worry about : ' Akh ! what a sacrifice he made for

my sake ! ' And I never thought of making a sacrifice ; I
was never so foolish as to make sacrifices, and I hope I never
shall be . I have done what was for my best good. I am
not a man to offer sacrifices ; and there are no such men in

existence.

It is a false term ; a sacrifice is equivalent to

such nonsense as ' top-boots with soft-boiled eggs ! ' One
acts in the way that's most agreeable ; now just go ahead
and preach this. It is accepted in theory, but when the
hard fact comes before a person, he is humiliated. You ,' he
says, ' are my benefactor,' and already the blade has shown
itself.
You ,' he says, ' have rescued me from the cellar .
How kind you are to me ! ' Why should I have bothered to
set you free, if I myself had not liked to do it? Is it I who
set you free, think you ? Do you think that I should take all

this trouble , unless it had afforded me myself some satisfac-

tion ? Maybe I have set myself free ; of course. I have.

I

myself want to live, want to love ; do you understand ? I
am doing everything for myself. Now, how can I manage
so as not to arouse this pernicious feeling of gratefulness
which would be so trying to her? Well, we'll manage it
somehow .

127

Of course, I did not intend to act this way ;

I intended to act otherwise . I thought that if she succeeded

in leaving her family, we would postpone the thing about
two years . In the meantime, I should have succeeded in
getting a professorship ; my finances would, by that time,
have been satisfactory : but it has proved to be impossible.
Well, what loss has it been to me ? Did I have myself in

view when it seemed to me that my money matters must be
in order beforehand ? What does a man need ?

A man does

not need anything. If he has boots, if he is not out at
elbows, if he has shchi [cabbage soup] , if he has a warm
room , what more does he want ?

And all this I have ; con-

sequently, what loss shall I have? But for a young and
pretty woman that is not enough !
" She must have pleasures ; she must succeed in society ;

and for this there will not be money enough.

Of course she

will not think that she is deprived of these things ; she is

a sensible , virtuous girl. She will say to herself : ' These
things are trifles ; it's all nonsense, and I despise them.'
And she will despise them. But does it help when a person
does not know what he is deprived of, or is even assured that

he is not in need of anything. It is an illusion, a fancy.
Nature is deadened by reason, circumstances, pride, and is
silent, and does not speak aloud about itself to the under-

standing ; and yet while it is silent, it works and undermines
life. A young woman, especially a pretty young woman,

must not live in that way ; it is not agreeable to be dressed
worse than others, and to be prevented from shining by
being scrimped in means. I am sorry for you, my poor little
girl ; I thought that something better would be arranged for
you. But what do Icare ? It is my gain. It is a question
whether she would consent to marry me two years hence,
and now she does ."

" Dmitri, come and drink your tea ! "
" I am coming ."

Lopukhóf went into Kirsánof's room, and on the way he
had time to think : " And how true it is that I am always

on the first floor ! I began with self and ended with self.
And why did I begin by calling it a sacrifice ? What nonsense ! as though I gave up my scientific reputation ! as
though I gave up my professorship ! Is it not all the same ?
I shall work in the same way ; I shall get a professorship
just the same, and likewise I shall serve the cause of medi

It is pleasant to a man who is a theorist to observe

how egotism plays with his ideas when he comes to put them
into practice."

I intend to forewarn the reader about all things, and
therefore I shall tell him not to suppose that this monologue

spoken by Lopukhóf contains a mysterious hint on the part
of the author as to some important motive in the further
development of the relations between Lopukhóf and Viéra
Pavlovna. Viéra Pavlovna's life will not be undermined by
being deprived of the means of shining in society and of
dressing expensively ; and her relations to Lopukhóf will not
be demoralized by a " pernicious feeling of gratefulness."
I am not one of those artists in whose every word is hidden
some kind of a spring. I am only relating what people have
done and thought. If any kind of an action, conversation,
monologue, is necessary for the characterizing of a person or

" No, she is not going to be a governess.

It has been

arranged otherwise. She will now be able for a while to
live a tolerable life in her own family."
" Well, that's good. It is pretty tough to be a governess .

How happy I am ! "

This was on Sunday evening .

On Monday came a lesson

given instead of Tuesday.

" My dear, my beloved ! ¹ how glad I am to be with you,
if only for a minute ! Do you know how many days there
are left for me to be in this cellar ? When will you be done ?
Will you be done by the tenth of July ? "
" Yes , Viérotchka."
" Then I shall have to sit in this cellar only seventy- two

days and this evening . One day I have marked off already.
See I have made a little calendar just as boarding-school

girls and boys do, and I cross off the days.

How delightful

it is to cross them off ! "

" My dear little Viérotchka, my dear ! Indeed, you have
not long to worry along here ; two months and a half will
quickly pass , and you will be free. "

" Akh ! how delightful it will be ! Only just at present,
my dearest, don't always talk with me, and don't look at
me ; and we must not play on the piano every time you come ,
either. And I shall not come out of my room every time
that you come here ; no , I shall not have enough strength
of mind for that. I shall come out always, if only for one
minute ; and I shall look at you so coldly ; not fondly at
all. And now I am going right away to my room. Good
by, my dear. When ? "
" Thursday ."

" Three days ; how long ! But then there will be only
sixty-eight days left."
" Count less ; about the seventh you will be able to get
away from here ."

" The seventh ? Then it is now only sixty-eight days .
How happy you have made me ! Good by, my dear. "
THURSDAY. - " My dearest, there are only sixty-six days
to stay here ."

" Yes , Viérotchka ; the time flies fast."

Viérotchka blushed .

" To the Nevsky Prospekt, mámenka."
" Then I am going with you, Viérotchka ; I have an errand at the Gostinui Dvor. What did you put on such a
dress as that for, Viérotchka, when you say you are going
to the Nevsky. You ought to put on a better one when you
are going to the Nevsky ; folks'll see you."
" I like this dress. Just wait one second, mámenka; I
want to get just one thing out of my room. "
They start ; they go. They reached the Gostinui Dvor.
They were going along the block that runs parallel with
Sadovaïa Street ; they are not far from the Nevsky corner ,
and here is Ruzanof's shop .

“ Mámenka, I have two words to tell you."
" What is the matter with you, Viérotchka? "
" Good by, mámenka. I don't know whether we shall
meet again soon. If you don't get angry, it'll be to-morrow."

" A quarter, lady ."

"All right ; only be quick about it. He will call upon
you this evening, mámenka; and don't get angry with me,

These words hardly reached Marya Alekséyevna's ears .
" Don't drive to Karavannaïa Street ; I only said so as to
get away from that lady as quickly as I could. Go to the left¹
down Nevsky. I must go much further than Karavannaïa
Street, to the Vasilyevsky Island, the fifth block behind the

to give me half a ruble. "

THE wedding had been managed in simple, and yet far
from common fashion .

Two days after the conversation which resulted in their
engagement, Viérotchka was delighted at her approaching

freedom. On the third day the " cellar," as she called it,
seemed twice as intolerable as before ; on the fourth day she
wept, which was contrary to her liking, but she did not weep
much ; on the fifth day she wept more ; on the sixth day she
did not weep at all, but she could not sleep from sorrow.
Lopukhóf looked on, then he spoke the monologue beginning
" Hm ! hm ! "

He looked a second time and spoke the mon-

ologue " Hm ! hm ! da, hm ! " At the first monologue he had a
dim suggestion of an idea, but he was not sure what it was ;
at the second monologue he saw plainly in his mind what he
imagined at the first. " It does not do to offer a person free-

dom and then leave him in prison." After that he thought
steadily for two hours, - an hour and a half on his way from
Semyonovsky bridge to Vuiborgsky, and half an hour on his
sofa. The first quarter of an hour he thought without wrinkling his forehead ; the remaining hour and three quarters he
wrinkled his forehead ; at the end of the two hours he struck

his forehead, and using worse words than Gogol's postmaster Telyatin (the calf) , looked at his watch, and saying, " Ten
o'clock, yes , there is time yet " left the room.
During the first quarter of an hour, when his brow was
smooth , this was what he thought, " It's all nonsense ; why
should I graduate ? I shall not be ruined if I don't get a
diploma, and it is not necessary. By lessons and translations I shall not make less ; I shall make even more than if I
had become a doctor ; bagatelles ! "

Consequently there was no need of wrinkling his brow ; to
tell the truth, the task did not appear to be of a head-split-

ting nature, partly because that from the first lesson he had
anticipated something in the nature of his present resolution.
He now perceived this.

And if any one had reminded him

of his arguments that began with the theme ' sacrifice ' and
ended with the thought of fine dresses , one might have
proved to him that something in the nature of these circum-

stances was anticipated from that very time, because otherwise
there would be no sense in the words " to renounce my scientific career."

At that time it seemed to him that he was not

going to renounce it, but instinct was already saying, “ Renounce it ; there will be no postponement ! " And if any one
had proved to Lopukhóf, as to a practical thinker, that there
was no ground then for his renunciation, he would have triumphed as a theoretical man, and would have said : “ Now
here is a new example for you of how egotism rules our

thoughts (for I ought to have seen, but I did not see, for I
was trying to look in another direction) , and rules our actions ; for why did I make the girl stay in her cellar ' a week
longer, when the matter ought to have been foreseen and provided for long ago ? "
But he remembered nothing of that kind, and it did not
,

occur to him because he had to wrinkle his forehead, and

while wrinkling it to think for an hour and three-quarters on
the question, " Who will marry us ? " and there was only one
answer all the time, " There is no one to marry us." But
suddenly in place of the answer, " No one to marry us ," the
name of Mertsálof came into his head ; then it was that he

struck himself on the forehead and swore with good reason.
" How is it possible that I did not think of Mertsálof at the
very beginning ? " And to a certain degree he was wrong in
his wonder ; he was not accustomed to think of Mertsáloť as
of a man who marries .

In the medical school there are a good many people of all
kinds ; there are among them some seminarists ; these men
have acquaintances in the theological seminary, and through
them Lopukhóf had also made acquaintances there. One of
the students whom he knew at the theological seminary not

an intimate, but a friend had graduated a year ago and had
become a priest, and was living in a certain building with
endless corridors on the Vasilyevsky Island. To him Lopukhóf went, and as it was an extra occasion and a late hour,
he took an izvoshchik .

Mertsálof was sitting alone in his room, and was reading
some new book - possibly by Louis XIV. , or some one else
of the same dynasty.

" Such and such is the state of things, Alekséi Petrovitch :
I know that it is a very serious risk for you to undertake ; it
is right enough if we get reconciled with the parents, but
suppose they begin a law-suit ? There may be some trouble
for you , and there probably will be ; but - "
Lopukhóf could not find in his mind anything to attach to
‫دو‬

his " but," for how in the world can you persuade a man to
put his neck for your sake into a noose ?
Mertsálof was also in a quandary, and tried hard to find a
" but" which would authorize him to run such a risk, and he
had no better success in getting beyond the " but."
" How can we arrange this matter ? I should certainly

like to. What you are doing now, I did ayear ago, and I
gave up my liberty just as you are going to do ! I have
some scruples, but I must help you out of it. Yet when one
has a wife, it is rather dangerous to go ahead without precaution."

" How are you ? good evening, Alósha : all my people send
their best regards to you . How are you, Lopukhóf ; we
haven't seen you for a long time. What is this that you are
speaking here about a wife ? Oh, yes , the wives are always
to blame ! "

This was said by a young married woman of about seventeen who had just come in from a visit to her parents ; she
was a pretty and lively blondinka .
Mertsálof told his wife about the state of things. The
young woman's eyes flashed.
" Alósha, they will not eat you up ! "
" There is a risk, Natasha ! "
" A very large risk," said Lopukhóf in corroboration.

" Well, what can be done ? you must run the risk, Alósha,
I beg of you."

" If you will not blame me, Natasha, for not taking you
into account in running into this danger, then that settles it .
When do you want to get married, Dmitri Sergéitch ? "
In point of fact all hindrances were set aside.

On Mon-

day morning Lopukhóf said to Kirsánof: " Do you know, Aleksandr, that I am going to make you
a present of my half of our work. Take my papers and
preparations ; I give it all up ; I am going to leave the medical school ; this is my last request ! I am going to be married ! "

Lopukhóf told him the whole story in a few words.
" If you were stupid or I were stupid, I should tell you ,
Dmitri, that this is the way that insane men act. But now I
shall not say any such thing. All the objections that I could
raise you must have thought over more than I have done.
And even if you have not thought them over, it does not
make any difference. Whether you are acting foolishly or
wisely I do not know, but at least I shall not attempt to act

so foolishly as to dissuade you, when I know that your mind
is made up . Can I be of any service or not ? "
" I want to find an apartment somewhere in an inexpensive

neighborhood - three rooms ; and I must make application

to get my medical school papers right away, to-morrow, if
possible ; so you will look us up a house. " 1
On Tuesday Lopukhóf got his papers, went to Mertsálof
and said that the wedding would be on the next day.

"At

what time would be most convenient for you, Alekséi Petróvitch? "

It makes no difference to Alekséi Petróvitch, as he stays at
home all day. " I think, though, that I shall have time to
send Kirsánof to let you know."

On Wednesday, at eleven o'clock, Lopukhóf went to the
boulevard, and after waiting for some time for Viérotchka
began to get worried ; but here she is , all out of breath .

" Viérotchka, my dear [drūg moï] , has anything happened

to you ?"
" No, mílenki, nothing ; I was late only because I overslept."

" That means what time did you go to bed ? "
" Milenki, I didn't want to tell you ; at seven o'clock, mílenki ; but I was thinking all night long ; no, it was earlier, it
was six ! "

" I want to ask you about something, my dear Viérotchka :
we must get married soon, mustn't we ? so that we may both
be comfortable ? "

" Yes , milenki, we must ; we must very soon ! "
" Then in four days, in three - "
" Akh ! if it could be so, milenki; then you would be a
smart boy ! "

" In three days I will surely find a house ; will buy everything for housekeeping, and then will it be possible for us to
live in it together ? "
" It will , my golubtchik, it certainly will ! ”
" But it will be necessary to get married first."

"Akh ! I forgot, milenki, that it was necessary to get married first ! "

"Well, we can get married to-day; that was the very
thing that I wanted to ask you about."
" Let us go right away and get married; and how have

you managed everything ? What a bright boy you are, mílenki !"
1 Before entering the medical school or any department of the Russian universities, a student is obliged to deposit with the authorities the certificate of his birth and

Here they are ! they have passed through the long corridors into the church, they have found the sexton, they have
sent for Mertsálof ; Mertsálof lived in the house where the
endless corridors were .

"Now, Viérotchka, I have to ask of you still another favor.
You know that they make young couples kiss each other in
church ? "

" Yes , my milenki; only how ridiculous it is ! "
" Well, lest it should be too ridiculous then, let us kiss
each other now . "

" Very well, let us kiss each other ; but could it not be
done without it ? "

" Yes , but it is impossible to get along without it in church ;

so let us prepare ourselves."
They kissed each other.

" Milenki, it is well that we have had time to prepare curselves ; here comes the sexton ; now it will not seem so ridiculous in church ! "
But it was not the sexton who came - the sexton did not

come till after the diakon ; it was Kirsánof, who had been
waiting for them at Mertsálof's .
" Viérotchka , this is Aleksandr Matvéitch Kirsánof, whom

you do not like, and whom you have forbidden me to meet."
" Viéra Pavlovna, what is the reason that you want to separate our tender hearts ? "

" For the very reason that they are tender," said Viérotchka, giving Kirsánof her hand and still smiling ; then
she fell into thought.

" But shall I be able to love him as

well as you do ? You love him very dearly, don't you ? "
" I ? I love no one but myself, Viéra Pavlovna ! "
" And you don't love him ? ”
" We have lived together, and we have never quarrelled ;
isn't that enough ? "

" And hasn't he loved you either ? "
" I never observed anything of the sort. However, let
us ask him. - Have you ever loved me, Dmitri ? "

" I never particularly despised you ! "
" Well , if that is the case , Aleksandr Matvéitch, I shall

not forbid your meeting, and I myself will love you ! "
" Now that is much better, Viéra Pavlovna. ”

" And now, I , too, am ready," said Alekséi Petrovitch,

coming in. " Let us go into the church." Aleksei Petró

vitch was gay and full of jests ; but when the ceremony began, his voice trembled, " Suppose it should result in a law-

suit ? Natasha, you must go back to your father ; your husband does not support you, and it is a wretched life to have
a husband alive , and to live on your father's bread ! "

How-

ever, after several words, he again regained complete control
of himself .

When the service was half over, Natalia Andréyevna, or
Natasha , as Alekséi Petrovitch called his wife, invited the

young people to come to her house after the ceremony ; she
had prepared a little breakfast. They came in, they laughed,
they even danced two quadrilles with two couples : they also
waltzed. Alekséi Petróvitch, who could not dance, played
the violin for them ; an hour and a half flew by quickly and
unnoticed.

It was a gay wedding.

" I think that they must be waiting dinner for me at
home," said Viérotchka, " it is about time. - Now, my mílenki, I shall be able to live three or four days in my cellar
without being melancholy, and possibly even more. Why
should I worry now ? There is nothing for me to fear now.
No, don't go home with me ; I am going all alone by myself,
so as not to be seen by anybody."
" It's all right ; they will not eat me up ; don't worry, gentlemen," said Alekséi Petróvitch, as he escorted Lopukhóf
and Kirsánof to the door, who had remained for a few min-

utes , so as to give Viérotchka a chance to get out of sight.
" I am very glad now that Natasha encouraged me ! "

On the following day, after a four days' hunt, a good house
was found, at the farther end of the fifth block on the Vasilyevsky Island. Having all in all one hundred and sixty rubles
in reserve , Lopukhóf concluded, with his friend, that it would

be impossible for him and Viérotchka to think as yet of
attempting to keep house, or to have their own furniture and
dishes ; and therefore they rented three rooms, together
with furniture, dishes, and board , from an old man, who

quietly spent his days, with a little stock of buttons , ribbons ,
pins, and other things, at the fence on the Middle Prospekt ,
between the first and second blocks ; while his evenings were

passed in quiet conversation with his old woman, who, for
her part, spent her days in mending hundreds and thousands
of old things of every sort, brought to her in bundles from
the Pushing Market. The servants also belonged to the
landlord ; in other words, they were the landlord and landlady themselves .

All this cost them thirty rubles a month. At that period
- ten years ago ( 1853 ) the times were not so hard in
Petersburg , judged by the Petersburg standard. With such
an arrangement, their means would last for three or even
four months. Ten rubles a month is enough for tea, isn't
it? and in four months Lopukhóf hoped to find pupils, some
kind of literary work, or even some kind of occupation in a
mercantile office,-he did not care what. On the very day
when the house was found (and, indeed, the house was
a very good one ; they looked out for that, and therefore they
found what they wanted) , Lopukhóf, while he was giving his
lesson on Thursday, as usual, said to Viérotchka : " To-morrow you can come to me, my dear ; here is the
address . I shall not say anything more now, lest they may
notice something . "

" My milenki, you have saved me ! "
Now, how to leave the house. Shall they confess what
they have done ? Viérotchka thought seriously about doing
so ; but her mother might lay violent hands on her, and might
even lock her up. Viérotchka concluded to leave a letter in
her room . When Marya Alekséyevna heard that her daughter was going to the Nevsky Prospekt, and said that she was
going too, Viérotchka went back to her room, and took the
letter ; it seemed to her that it was better, more honorable ,
if she herself told her mother to her face ; for on the street

her mother would not attempt to beat her, and it would only
be necessary to stand at a distance from her while speaking,
to take an izvoshchik as soon as possible, and then drive off
before she had time to catch her by the sleeve.
In such a manner the effective scene came about at Ruzanof's store.

yevna, who had suspected nothing of the kind, stood thunderstruck, endeavoring to understand, and absolutely failing to
understand, what her daughter had said, what it meant, and
how it came about ; but it was only for a moment, or even
less .

She came to herself with a start.

She uttered some

objurgation or other ; but her daughter was already far down

the Nevsky. Marya Alekséyevna dashed several steps in
her direction .

She turned to

A VITAL QUESTION.

139

" Izvoshchik ! "

" Where do you want to go, lady? " Where did she want
togo? she heard her daughter say, " To Karavannaïa Street " ;

but her daughter turned to the left down the Nevsky. Where
does she want to go ?

" I want to overtake her yonder, that beast ! "
" To ketch some one ? Speak sense ; where do you want
to go ? How can I go without any directions ? And you
hain't given me any idea. "
Marya Alekséyevna entirely lost control of herself, and
she began to berate the izvoshchik.
" You are drunk, baruina; that's all there is of it," said

the izvoshchik, and left her. Marya Alekséyevna ran after
him, still scolding, and she shouted at the other izvoshchiks,
and she dashed in all directions for some time, and she gesticulated with her hands , and then she went back under the

colonnade, and she kicked and she acted like a mad woman ;
and around her were gathered half a dozen rude fellows, who
had been peddling various articles around the columns of the

Gostinui Dvor.

The fellows were laughing at her, and they

exchanged among themselves words of more or less unfavor-

able character, and they praised her ironically, and they
offered her their advice to be calm .

" Ay ! da ! baruina ! how early you managed to get full !
lively baruina ! "
" Baruina ! ah ! baruina ! buy half a dozen lemons of me ;

they are good to take when you're tipsy ; I'll let thee have
them cheap . "
“ Baruina ! ah ! baruina ! don't listen to him ; a lemon

won't do you the least good ; but go and take a nap."
“ Baruina ! ah ! baruina ! you're a good hand at scolding ;
let's get up a scolding match, and see who'll beat ! "
Marya Alekséyevna, not knowing at all what she was about,
boxed the ears of one of the nearest of her interlocutors , - a

fellow of seventeen, who, not without grace, was stretching
out his tongue at her ; his hat flew off, and his hair was right

at hand.

Marya Alekséyevna got her fingers into it.

This

act roused the rest of her interlocutors into a state of indescribable enthusiasm .

" Ay ! baruina ! give it to him ! " Others shouted : " Fyedka ! give it back to her in small change ! "

But the majority of the interlocutors were on Marya
Alekséyevna's side .

" How can Fyedka stand up to her ? "

A good many spectators had now collected besides the
interlocutors, both izvoshchiks, and the clerks of the shops,
and the passers-by. Marya Alekséyevna, as though coming
to her senses, and with a final mechanical motion pushing
away Fyedka's head, started across the street. The enthusiastic praises of her interlocutors accompanied her.
She saw that she was on the way home after she had
passed the doors of the " School of Pages " ; she took an
izvoshchik and reached home in safety. Finding Feódor at
the door, she gave him a beating ; she rushed to the cup-

board ; she pounded Matrióna, who came out to see what
made the noise ; again she rushed to the cupboard ; she

dashed to Viérotchka's room, then she rushed back again to
the cupboard ; once more she dashed to Viérotchka's room,
and remained there a long time ; then she made a tour of all

the rooms , scolding, but finding no one on whom to lay her
hands .

Feódor had run to the rear stairs ; Matrióna, who

was looking through the crack of Viérotchka's room, frightened out of her wits , ran back when she saw that Marya

Alekséyevna was getting up. She lost her head, and could
not find her way to the kitchen, but found herself instead
under Marya Alekséyevna's bed, where she remained in
safety until she was called out under a flag of truce.

Whether it was a long or short period that she was scolding and shouting as she walked through the empty rooms,
Marya Alekséyevna could never tell ; but it must have been
long, because when Pavel Konstantinuitch came from his
office, he also had a dose both materially and ideally from
Marya Alekséyevna. But as everything must come to an
end, Marya Alekséyevna cried out, " Matrióna, let us have
dinner ! "

Matrióna saw that the storm was ended ; she

crept out from under the bed and got dinner.
At dinner Marya Alekséyevna did not scold at all, but she
only growled without any intentions of attacking ; but only
for her own satisfaction ; and afterwards she did not take a

nap, but sat down alone and did not speak, but was growling.
Then she stopped growling and became absolutely silent ;
finally she cried out : " Matrióna ! wake the barin , and tell him to come to me ! "

Matrióna, who, while expecting orders, did not dare to go

into the dining-room or anywhere else, fulfilled the command.
Pavel Konstantinuitch appeared .

" Go to the khozyáïka and tell her that our daughter has
married that devil because you wished her to.

Tell her,

' It was against my wife's will.' Tell her that you did so, so
as to please her ladyship, because you saw that it was not
her ladyship's wish. Tell her, My wife was alone to blame,
and I only carried out your ladyship's will.' Tell her, ' I

myself brought them together.' Do you understand or not ?”
" I understand you, Marya Alekséyevna.

You are very

wise in your plan."
" Well then, go along with you ! Even if she is eating
her dinner, don't mind ; call her right out ! Bring her from
the dinner-table ! so long as she does not know the real
truth."
The assurance of Pavel Konstantinuitch's words was so

impressive that the khozydïka would have believed him even
if he had not possessed the gift of a persuasive tongue.
But the impressiveness of this gift was so great that the
khozyáïka would have forgiven Pavel Konstantinuitch, even
if there had not been substantial proofs that he had con-

stantly acted against his wife, and purposely brought Viérotchka and Lopukhóf together, in order to block the
" ignoble marriage " of Mikhaïl Ivanuitch. But how did

they get married ? Pavel Konstantinuitch was not stingy in
giving her a dowry. He had given Lopukhóf five thousand
rubles in cash, and he had given the marriage and all its
cost at his own expense. Through him the young people
had exchanged little notes. They had met at the house of
his colleague, the natchalnik Filantyef, " a married man,
your ladyship. Although I am a man of little account, the
maiden honor of my daughter, your ladyship, is dear to me.
They met in my presence ; and although we have not money
enough to justify giving a boy of the age of ours a tutor,
yet I hired one for an excuse, your ladyship," etc., etc. His
wife's unreliability Pavel Konstantinuitch depicted in the
darkest colors .

How then could she help being convinced and forgiving
Pavel Konstantinuitch ? And the main thing -what a great
and unexpected piece of happiness ! Joy softens the heart.
The khozydïka began her speech of forgiveness with a very
long explanation of the thoughts and actions of Marya
Alekséyevna, and at first asked Pavel Konstantinuitch to

send his wife away ; but he implored her, and she herself
acknowledged , that it was rather for show than because she

meant it. Finally it was decided that Pavel Konstantinuitch should retain his place as manager ; that they
should give up their rooms facing the street and take
another suite in the back of the building , on condition that
his wife should not dare to show her face in those places on

the first dvor where the khozydïka's eyes might fall ; and
that she should be obliged to go out of doors, when she
went at all, by a staircase that lay far from the khozydika's
windows . From the twenty rubles a month that had been
added to his salary, fifteen rubles should be taken back and
five rubles would be left to him for a compensation for the

manager's energy in the khozyáïka's interests and towards
the expenses of his daughter's wedding.
XXIII .

MARYA ALEKSÉYEVNA had a number of schemes in mind as

to the way to act towards Lopukhóf when he should come in
the evening. The most revengeful was to hide two dvorniks
in the kitchen, who at a given signal should throw themselves

on Lopukhóf, and beat him to death. The most pathetic was
solemnly to pronounce with her own lips, aided by Pavel
Konstantinuitch, a parental curse on their disobedient daugh-

ter and on him, their murderer, with an explanation that the
curse was valid, - even the earth, as is well known, does not

receive the dust of those who are cursed by their parents .
But this belonged to the same category of imaginations as
the khozyáïka had, in regard to separating Pavel Konstantinuitch from his wife ; for such schemes, like any other

poetry, have no practical application, properly speaking, except to relieve the heart, by furnishing a framework for endless thoughts in solitude, and for other explanations, when,
by and by, she should come to speak about it ; as, for example, he or she might have done this or that, and he or she

intended to do so, but, owing to his or her kindness, he or
she felt grieved to do so.

The plan of beating Lopukhóf and cursing her daughter
were the ideal part of Marya Aleksévevna's thoughts and

feelings. But the actual part of her mind and soul took a
direction not so lofty, but more practical ; and this difference

is attributable to the inherent weakness of every human be

ing.

143

When Marya Alekséyevna came to her senses, at the

gates of the " School of Pages," she comprehended that her

daughter had really disappeared, was married, and had left
her for good and all ; and this fact came before her imagina-

tion in the form of the following mental exclamation, " She
has robbed me ! " And all the way home she kept exclaiming mentally, and sometimes even audibly, " She has robbed
me ! "

And, therefore, while she was detained for several

minutes by the process of communicating her grievance to
Feódor and Matrióna, through human weakness, - every
human being is carried away, by the expression of feeling, to
such an extent that he often forgets, in the excitement of the

spirit, the interests of the moment,-Marya Alekséyevna ran
into Viérotchka's room, peeked into the drawers of her bu-

reau, into her wardrobe ; she cast a hasty glance over everything ; no, apparently everything is untouched. And then
she began to confirm this reassuring impression by a careful
examination. The result was that really all her dresses and
things remained there, with the exception of a pair of simple
gold ear-rings , and an old white mousseline dress, and an old
cloak, which Viérotchka wore when she went away. As regarded the practical direction in which Marya Alekséyevna's
acts would take, she expected that Viérotchka would give
Lopukhóf an inventory of her things, which he would ask
for ; and she firmly decided that she should give her nothing
from among her possessions of gold and the like, that she
would give her four of the simplest of her dresses, and some
of the thinnest and oldest of her underwear. To give her
nothing was impossible, since her noble generosity would not
allow it ; and Marya Alékséyevna had always been very strict
in her observance of noble generosity.
Another question of actual life was her relation to the
khozyáïka ; we have already seen that Marya Alekséyevna
successfully solved the answer to it.
Now, there is a third question , " What can be done with

the hussy and the rascal ? " that is, with her daughter
and her unexpected son-in-law. Curse them ? that is not
hard : but it is useless , except as a dessert after something

substantial . Only how is this substantial something possible ? To lodge a complaint, to bring about a lawsuit, to
have them arrested !

At first, when her feelings were all

stirred up. Marya Alekséyevna looked upon this solution of
the question from an ideal standpoint, and ideally it seemed


======================================================================

144

A VITAL QUESTION.

to her very delightful. But, in proportion as her blood grew
calmer, after the weariness of the storm, the matter began
to appear in a different light. Nobody knew better than
Marya Alekséyevna that- lawsuits are conducted through the
agency of money, and money alone ; and such cases as charmed
hér by their ideal beauty are conducted through the agency
of large , very large, sums of money, and they are dragged
out unendingly, and, after wasting a great deal of money, they
often come to nothing in the end.

" What is to be done [tchto dyélat] ? "

At the final up-

shot it seemed that there were only two courses to take : to
quarrel with Lopukhóf to her heart's content , and to retain
Viérotchka's things when he demanded them, and, as a means
of doing that, to threaten him with a lawsuit. But she certainly must quarrel to her full sweetness .

But she did not succeed in quarrelling. Lopukhóf came,
and began by saying, " Viérotchka and I ask you, Marya
Alekséyevna and Pavel Konstantinuitch, to forgive us for
taking this step without your consent."
On hearing this , Marya Alekséyevna cried, " I shall curse
her, the good-for-nothing ! "

But, instead of saying the whole word " good-for-nothing," Marya Alekséyevna had only time to say " goodfor-n-," because Lopukhóf interrupted her, in a loud voice :
" I shall not listen to your abuse ; I came to speak about business . You are angry, and you cannot speak calmly, and so
I will talk only with Pavel Konstantinuitch ; and, Marya
Alekséyevna, you send Feódor and Matrióna to call us when
you get calmed down. "

While saying this , he started to lead Pavel Konstantinuitch
from the parlor into his bed-room ; and he spoke so loud that
there was no chance of out-crying him, and therefore she was
obliged to stop off short.
He took Pavel Konstantinuitch to the parlor door ; here he

stopped, turned around, and said : " And now, Marya Alek-

séyevna, I am going to talk with you ; but only about business , and it must be calmly."
She was about to lift her voice a second time, but he

interrupted her again, " Nu, if you can't speak calmly, then
we shall leave you . "

" Now, what makes you go out, you fool [durak] ? " she
shouted.

" Well, he is leading me out ! "


======================================================================

A VITAL QUESTION.

145

" And if Pavel Konstantinuitch did not choose to speak
calmly, then I would leave ; it would not make any difference to me. But why should you, Pavel Konstantinuitch,
allow yourself to be called such names ? Marya Alekséyevna
does not understand business ; she really thinks that she
can do anything that she pleases with us ; but you are a
tchinovnik, you are a man of experience ; you of course

understand propriety. You tell her that she cannot do anything with Viérotchka now, and still less with me. "
" The rascal must know that nothing can be done to him,"
thought Marya Alekséyevna, and she said to Lopukhóf that,
being her mother, she was excited at first, but now she could
speak coolly.

Lopukhóf returned with Pavel Konstantinuitch ; they sat
down.

Lopukhóf asked her to listen until he should finish

what he had to say, and to postpone what she had to reply ,
and then he began to speak, lifting his voice powerfully
whenever she attempted to interrupt him, and thus he finished his speech in safety. It was to this effect : that it
was impossible to untie them, and therefore the case of Storeshnikof was beyond recall ; " as you know yourself ; consequently it will be idle for you to take the trouble. However,
do as you please ; if you have extra money, I even advise
you to try it ; and, then, again there is hardly any reason for

being vexed, because Viérotchka never wanted to marry
Storeshnikof ; consequently, this case was always beyond
realization , as you yourself have seen, Marya Alekséyevna ;

and young girls must certainly marry, and, as a general
thing, they are lost to their parents. It would be necessary
to give a dowry, and then a wedding itself would cost a
good deal of money ; but the main thing is the dowry ; consequently, Marya Alekséyevna, you and your husband ought
to be thankful to your daughter for marrying without causing you any expense." He spoke in this style, and he spoke
with such detail that it took him a good half-hour.
When he finished, Marya Alekséyevna saw that there was
no use in bulldozing such a rogue, and therefore she began
to speak about her feelings : how she was particularly
grieved that Viérotchka should have married without asking
her parents' consent, because it was very painful for a
mother's heart. Now, when a thing touches a mother's feelings and grievances, then, naturally, the conversation takes
a turn, as though it were impossible not to speak about

them : this, propriety demands. Now they have satisfied
propriety, - they have spoken about this interesting fact.
Marya Alekséyevna has said that, as a loving mother, she

was grieved ; Lopukhóf has said that she , as a loving mother,
had no need of being grieved ; and having fulfilled the measure of propriety , by a discourse of suitable length about feelings , they took up another point , also demanded by propriety ,

to wit : that she had always wished her daughter to be
happy.

This was said on one side ; and on the other side

the reply was made that this was a thing that could never
be doubted.

When the conversation had been prolonged

to a suitable length on this point also, they began to take
leave of each other, also with explanations of such a length,
as is demanded by propriety among gentlefolk, and the result of it all proved that Lopukhóť, understanding the sorrow of a mother's heart, did not ask Marya Alekséyevna's
consent for her daughter to come to see her, because,
maybe it would be hard for a mother's heart ; but when

Marya Alekséyevna should have heard that Viérotchka was
living happily, which, of course, was Marya Alekséyevna's
sole desire , then her maternal heart would be entirely calmed ;
consequently, then she would be able to see her daughter
without being grieved.

Thus they came to this wise conclusion, and separated
peacefully.

" Well, he's a keen one," said Marya Alekséyevna to
herself, as she escorted her son-in-law to the door.

That night she dreamed a dream of this nature : she was
sitting at the window, and saw on the street an elegant carriage passing along the street, and the carriage stopped, and
from the carriage stepped a handsomely dressed lady and a
man, and they came into her room, and the lady said, " Look,

mamasha , how well my husband dresses me ! " and this
lady was Viérotchka. And Marya Alekséyevna seemed to
see that the stuff of which the dress was made was of the

very best, and Viérotchka said : " The material alone cost
five hundred silver rubles , and that is a trifle for us , mamasha;
and I have a whole dozen of dresses like this ! and this ,

mamasha, cost more , here, look at my fingers ! " Marya
Alekséyevna looked at Viérotchka's fingers ; and on her
fingers were rings with large diamonds . " This ring, mamasha, is worth two thousand rubles ; and this one here,

mamasha , cost more, - four thousand rubles , - and look
at my breast, mamasha ! this brooch cost still more ; it is

worth ten thousand rubles ! " And then the gentleman
spoke,-and the gentleman was Dmitri Sergéitch : " All these
are mere trifles for us, dear mámenka Marya Alekséyevna ;
but the thing of the most importance is here in my pocket.
Look, dear mámenka, at my pocket-book ! How fat it is !
there are nothing but hundred-ruble notes in it, and I am
going to make you a present, mamasha, of this pocket-book,
because it is a trifle to us .

But this other pocket-book is

still fatter, dear mámenka ; I do not give it to you, because
it has no paper money, but only bonds and mercantile notes ,
and every bond and note is worth more than the whole

pocket-book which I just gave you, dear mámenka Marya
Alekséyevna. "

" You have succeeded, dear son Dmitri Sergéitch, in making my daughter and all our family happy ; but where in the
world, my dear son, did you get so much wealth ? " “ I,
66

dear mamasha, became a monopolist ! "

And while she was awaking from her dream, Marya Alekséyevna thinks to herself, " Indeed, it would be a good

thing if he became a monopolist ! "
XXIV .

A WORD OF PRAISE FOR MARYA ALEKSÉYEVNA .

You have ceased to be a person of any importance in Vié-

rotchka's life, Marya Alekséyevna, and now that we are going to part from you, the author of this narrative begs you
not to complain, that you are dismissed from the stage with

an epilogue which is somewhat unfavorable to you. Do not
think that we will treat you without due respect. You were
fooled, but that does not in the least lessen our respect for

your good sense, Marya Alekséyevna ; your mistake does not
testify against you. You were thrown in contact with people
such as had never before crossed your path, and therefore it
was no crime that you were mistaken in them when you judged

them by your former experience. Allyour former life brought
you to the conclusion that people were divided into two
classes , - fools and rascals :

" Whoever is not a fool must

be a rascal," you used to think ; " and he who is not a rascal
can only be a fool."


======================================================================

148

A VITAL QUESTION.

This view was very true, Marya Alekséyevna, until within

a very short time, Marya Alekséyevna. You have met
with people, Marya Alekséyevna, who spoke very glibly,
and you saw that all these people, without a single exсерtion, were either foxy , throwing dust in the eyes of others ,

or full-grown stupids, not knowing life and not having
the wit to accommodate themselves to circumstances .

And

therefore, Marya Alekséyevna, you considered them as evincing stupidity and fair game for deceit, and you were right,
Marya Alekséyevna. Your opinion of men was already entirely formed when you met the first woman who was neither
stupid nor villanous ; it was excusable that you got confused
and did not know what to think of her or how to treat her .

Your views of people were already entirely formed when you
met the first noble-minded man, who was not a simple, pitiable child, who knew life as thoroughly as you did, whose
judgments of it were not less correct than your own, who
could transact business with no less skill than you ; it was
excusable that you were mistaken in him and looked upon
him as a scoundrel like yourself. These mistakes, Marya
Alekséyevna, do not lessen my regard for you as a clever
and active woman. You brought your husband up from
nothingness ; you have gained for yourself a competency
against your declining years , these are good things, and
they were hard for you to accomplish. Your method was bad,
but your environment gave you no other method. Your
methods belong to your environment, and not to you personally, and hence it is not to your dishonor, but it is a credit
to your intellect and strength of character.

Are you satisfied, Marya Alekséyevna, with this acknowl-

edgment of your good qualities ? Of course you must be
satisfied with this, because you never thought of claiming to
be lovely or gentle. In a moment of involuntary frankness,
you yourself confessed that you were a bad and dishonorable
woman, and you did not look upon your wickedness and dis-

honesty as disgraceful to you, because you proved that your
environment would not allow you to be otherwise. Consequently, you will not care, because in addition to the praise
of your intellect and strength of character no praise has
been bestowed upon you for your good qualities ; you yourself don't claim to have them, and you do not look upon them
as worth having, but rather you regard them as characteristic

of stupidity.

Consequently you will not ask further praise

than what I have just given you. But I can say one
thing more in your favor : of all the people whom I do not
like, and with whom I do not like to have business , I would

rather deal with you than all the rest. Of course you are
unmerciful wherever it affects your advantage ; but if you
have no advantage in doing anybody harm, you will not do
it out of stupid little spitefulness. You consider that it is
not worth while to lose time, labor, and money without return. Of course you would have been glad to roast your
daughter and her husband over a slow fire ; but you were able
to curb your revengeful inclination and to reason the matter

over coolly, and you understood that you had no chance of
success in roasting them, and this is a great thing, Marya

Alekséyevna, to be able to recognize an impossibility ! When
you once recognized it you gave up your idea of beginning a
lawsuit, since the lawsuit would not punish the people who
stirred up your anger ; you calculated that those little unpleasantnesses , which a lawsuit would cause them, would
bring you yourself into more bother and expense, and therefore you did not begin the lawsuit. If it is impossible to conquer an enemy ; if, in causing him a trifling loss you are causing yourself a greater, then you had better not begin the
battle ; you understood this , and you had the common sense
and courage to yield to an impossibility, without unnecessarily
causing harm to yourself or anybody else : this, too, was a

great thing, Marya Alekséyevna. Yes, Marya Alekséyevna,
one can get along with you ; you do not indulge in wrath for
the sake of wrath, to your own detriment : and this is a very

rare and very important quality, Marya Alekséye na. Millions of people are more injurious to themselves and others
than you are, Marya Alekséyevna, even though they may not
have that detestable side that you have. You are better than
the majority of those who are simply bad, because you are
not without reason and are not stupid. I should have been
glad to sponge you off from the face of the earth, but I have
a certain regard for you : you do harm in no way. Now you
are spending your time in mean business because your environment is so constituted, but put you into other circum-

stances, and you would take delight in being harmless, in being even useful, because you do not want to do any harm
without being paid for it, and it were profitable to you, you
could do whatever you wanted ; consequently. you would act

honorably and nobly if it were advisable. You are capable

of doing so, Marya Alekséyevna, and you are not to blame
because this capability is latent ; that instead of doing so,
you are acting in a contrary way ; but you possess it, and
this cannot be said of all.

Wretches are capable of doing

anything. You are only a bad woman, but you are not hopelessly a wretched woman. You are higher than many, even
if judged by the moral standard.

" What should I be satisfied for, bátiushka. My circumstances are bad, aren't they ? "

PART THIRD .
MARRIAGE AND

SECOND LOVE .

I.

THREE months have passed since Viérotchka was rescued
from the cellar. The Lopukhófs' affairs have prospered .
He has had a fair number of pupils ; he obtained work of a

certain publisher, to translate a text-book on geography.
Viéra Pavlovna also found two pupils, not of the highest
grade, but still not to be despised. Together they have an
income of eighty rubles a month. But such an income
scarcely allows any one to live luxuriously, but they ran no
risk of running into poverty. Their means have gradually
increased, and they have calculated that in four months or
even sooner they can set up their own establishment. And
this was afterwards realized .

The system of their lives was arranged, of course not

absolutely in accordance with Viérotchka's half-jesting,
half-serious plan proposed on the day of their fantastic
engagement, but nevertheless it was very much like it. The
old man and woman at whose house they lived, gossiped
together about the strange way in which the young couple
lived- as though they were not young people at all, not
even like husband and wife ; like nobody else in the world .
" Well, now, Petrovna, it seems to me just as queer as it

does to you . You could not tell for the life of you whether
she wan't his sister and he her brother ! "

" You think that's a good comparison, do you ? Between
brother and sister there ain't any ceremony at all. But look
at them ! He gits up, puts on his clo'es, and sits down and
waits till the samovar is brought. Then he makes tea and
calls her, and she too comes out all dressed.

What kind of

a brother and sister's that ? You had better say this : being
as there's poor folks who through their poverty have to live
two families in one apartment ; and you might compare them
to such ! "

" And how is it, Petrovna, that a husband can't go into

What does that look like ? "

" You ought to see how they part at night. She says :
' Proshchaï mílenki, good night.' Then they separate, each
to sit in their own rooms. They read books, and he sometimes writes. Just you listen and I'll tell you what happened once.

She went to bed and was reading a book.

Then I heard through the partition (it happened I was wide
awake that night) ; I hear her a gittin' up. And what do
you think ?

I was list'nin' .

She was a- standin' before her

lookin' glass a-combin' of her hair. Well [nu] , she seemed
to be gittin' ready to go out to see some comp'ny. I was
list'nin' . Out she went. Then [nu] I, too, goes out into
the entry, gits up in a chair, and peeks through the transom
into his room.

I was list'nin' as she went to the door.

Can I come in, milenki ? ' And he says, ' In a minute,
Viérotchka. ' He too was in bed. He put on his pants and
his coat. Now [nu ] , thinks I, he'll be tyin' up his cravat.
But he don't put on his cravat ; he fixes hisself a little, and

says, ' Now you can come in, Viérotchka.' Says she, ‘ I
don't understand something in this book ; please explain it
to me.' He tells her.
Well [nu] , mílenki, forgive me for
botherin' of you.' And says he, ' Oh, it's nothin' , Viérotchka ; I was only lyin' down, you haven't disturbed me.'

" And

" And so she went out."
" And wan't there nothin' more ? "

" No , nothin' more .

But it ain't so queer't she went out

so, as 'twas 'cause she went and dressed herself when she

went to see him.

He says , ' Just wait.'

Then he dressed

hisself, and then he says, ' Come in.' You better tell me
this : what kind of actions is them ? "

" It must be this way, Petrovna ; it's a kind of sect, I
reckon, 'cause you know there's a good many kind of
sects ."

" It looks like it.

See here ! I guess your idee is right."

Here is another conversation :

" Daniluitch, I axed her about them actions of theirn .

Says I, Don't git mad at my question ; but what's your
religious views .'

she said. Says I, ' Don't you belong to any sec' ? ' Says she,
' No, I don't belong to any. What makes you think so ? '
'Because,' says I, because, lady, I don't know whether to
call you Miss or Mrs. Do you live with your old man ? '
She laughed. Why, yes , says she , ' o' course I do. "
" She laughed, did she ? "
" Yes , she did. ' O' course I live with him,' says she.
' Then, ' says I, ' what makes you act as you do? You never
see him without his clo'es on, as though you wan't his wife.'
And, says she, ' It's because I don't want him to see me in
dishabilly.' Oh no, they don' belong to any sec's at all.
' Then,' says I, ' what makes you do so ? ' ' So as to keep
love in the house and git rid of quarrels,' says she.
" Well now , Petrovna, that looks as though she spoke the
6

truth .

Of course , she allus wants to look decent ! "

" And then she goes on and says, says she, ' If I don't
want other folks to see me in dishabilly, then why should
my husband, whom I love more, see me before I have

washed my face.

It wouldn't do to show myself before him

in any such way. "

" Well, so does that look as though she spoke the truth,
Petrovna .

What makes men fall in love with other men's

wives ? It's because they see then nicely dressed, while
they see their own wives - how did you call it ? oh, yes, in
dishabilly . It's said so in Holy Writ, in Solomon's Proverbs , and he was the wisest of the Tsars ! "

II .

The affairs of the Lopukhófs prospered. Viéra Pavlovna
was always happy. But one time (this was some five
months after the wedding) Dmitri Sergéitch, returning from
one of his lessons, found his wife in a peculiar state of
mind. Her eyes were shining with pride and happiness .
This caused Dmitri Sergéitch to remember that for several
days past he had seen in her some signs of mental exaltation, joyful thoughts, and tender pride.

" My dear, you seem to be so happy ; why don't you give
us the benefit of it ? "

" I think I am, my dear ; but you just wait a little while .

I will tell you when I am sure that I am right. You must
wait for several days. And it is going to be a great joy to

Mertsálof will be pleased with it."
" But what in the world is it ? "

" Ah, you have forgotten our agreement, haven't you,
not to ask questions ? I will tell you when I am sure of it."
Another week passed by .
" My mílenki, I am going to tell you my joy ; only you
must give me your advice, because you know all about it.
You know that I have been wanting for a long, long time
to do something great ; and I have made up my mind that we
must start a sewing union. Isn't that a good idea ? "
" Now, my dear, we made an agreement that I should
not kiss your hand, but that was a general rule ; it did not
include such an occasion as this. Give me your hand, Viéra
Pavlovna ! "

"By and by, my milenki, when I have succeeded in doing
it."

"When you have succeeded, then I shall not be the only
one to kiss it : Kirsánof and Alekséi Petrovitch , all will want

to kiss it.

But now I am alone ; and the intention is worthy

of it."

" Violence ! I shall scream ! "
" Scream then ! "

“ Milenki moï ! I shall be ashamed, and tell you nothing.
As though it were anything of such great importance ! "
" Here is where its importance lies : we all make plans,
but we don't accomplish anything. But you began to think
long after the rest of us , and sooner than all of us have re-

solved to put your ideas to the test."
Viérotchka bent her head on her husband's breast, and
hid her face . " My dear, you have praised me to death. "
Her husband kissed her head.

" What a clever little

head ! "

“ Milenki moï, stop ! It is impossible to tell you anything ! Do you know what kind of a man you are ? "
" I will stop. Tell me, my tender-hearted girl."
" Don't you dare to address me so ! "
" Well, you hard-hearted one . "

"Akh ! what kind of a man are you, all the time interrupting me ? Just listen. Sit down quietly. Here, it seems to
me, is the main thing : that at the very beginning, when you
select a few, to make the selection very carefully. You must
have really honorable, good people, not narrow-minded, not

fickle, but steady, and at the same time gentle, so that there
should not be any idle quarrels among them, and that they
should be able to select others of the same kind.

Isn't that

so ?"

" Yes , dear."

" Now, I have three such girls. Akh ! how long I had
to hunt ! Now here, my dearest, for the last three months I
have been going round among the shops trying to make
acquaintances , and I have succeeded. Such nice girls ! I
have got thoroughly acquainted with them. "
"And then, moreover, they must be thoroughly up in
their art.

The business must stand on its own merits .

Everything must have a solid foundation of mercantile calculations ."
" Akh ! of course it must."

" What more is left? Why do you need my advice, then ? "
" In regard to the details, moï mílenki. ”
" Tell me the details . Of course you must have thought
yourself about everything , and you willbe able to accommodate yourself to circumstances. You know that the most important thing here is principle, character, and knowledge.
Details come of themselves from the conditions peculiar to
every circumstance . "

" I know ; but after all, when you give your approval, I
shall be more assured ."

They talked for a long time.

Lopukhóf found nothing

to correct in his wife's plan ; butas far as she was concerned,

the plan developed and became more and more clear as she
talked it over with him .

On the next day Lopukhóf took to the office of the " Police
News " an advertisement : " Viéra Pavlovna Lopukhóva

would take orders for sewing ladies' garments, linen, etc. , at
moderate prices , etc. "

On that very morning Viéra Pavlovna went to see Julie.
" She does not know my married name. Tell her Mademoiselle Rozálskaïa."

" My child, you are without a veil.

You come to me

openly, and tell your name to the servant. Now this is
sheer folly. You are ruining yourself, my child ! "
" Yes, but I am married now, and I can go wherever I
please, and do what I want to."

" But your husband; he may find it out."
" He will be here in an hour."


======================================================================

156

A VITAL QUESTION.

Then the questions began as to how she got married. Julie
was delighted. She hugged her, she kissed her, she wept.
When she became calmer, Viéra Pavlovna told her the purpose of her visit.

" You know that old friends are not thought of, except
when their help is needed. I have a great favor to ask of you .
I am going to establish a sewing shop. Give me your orders
and recommend me to your acquaintances. I myself sew
nicely and I have good apprentices. You know one of
them." Aud, in fact, Julie knew one of them to be a good
seamstress . " Here are specimens of my work. This garment I made myself ; you see how nicely it fits. "
Julie examined very carefully the fit of the garment ; she
looked at the embroidery of the shawl, at the little cuffs ,
and she was satisfied .

" My child, you might be very successful ; you have both
skill and taste. But to succeed you must have a great shop
on the Nevsky."

" Yes, I shall establish one there in good time. Now I
take orders at home . "

Having finished talking about business, they began to talk
again about Viérotchka's marriage .
" And that Storeshnik drank terribly for a couple of weeks ,

and then he made up with Adèle. And I am very glad for
Adèle's sake. He is a kind fellow. I am only sorry that
Adèle has not a better reputation . "
As it came up naturally, Julie began to talk about the adventures of Adèle and others . Now Mademoiselle Rozálskaïa

is a married lady, and Julie does not think it necessary to
hold her tongue. At first she spoke reasonably; then she
was drawn away, drawn away, and began with delight to
depict their dissipated existence, and she went on and on.
Viéra Pavlovna was embarrassed, but Julie did not heed it.
Viéra Pavlovna recovered her self-possession , and listened

with that cruel interest with which you examine the features
of a lovely face disfigured by disease. But Lopukhóf came
in. Julie in an instant was changed into a stately woman
of the world, full of the sternest dignity. However, she did
not keep up that rôle very long. After she had congratulated
Lopukhóf on his wife, " such a beauty," she again got excited. " Now, we must celebrate your wedding." She ordered
a breakfast off-hand; she offered champagne. Viérotchka

had to drink half a glass in honor of her wedding, half a


======================================================================

A VITAL QUESTION.

157

glass in honor of her " union," and half a glass in honor of
Julie herself. Her head began to turn. She and Julie shout,
laugh, and get excited. Julie pinches Viérotchka ; she jumps ;
she runs away, Viérotchka after her ; they run all over the
apartment, jumping over the chairs ; Lopukhóf sits and
laughs. It ended with Julie making up her mind to exhibit
her strength .

" I am going to lift you up with one hand ! "
" You can't do it ! "

They began to wrestle ; they both fell on the sofa and
neither felt like getting up, and so they lay there laughing
until they fell asleep.

For the first time in many years Lopukhóf did not know
what to do. " Should he waken them? It is a pity ; you
may spoil a pleasant meeting by making a bad ending ! "
He carefully got up, went across the room to see if he could
find a book . He found a book, " Chronique de l'Eil de
Bœuf," in comparison with which " Faublas " is virtue
itself. He sat down on a sofa, at the other end of the

room, began to read, and in a quarter of an hour, he himself
fell asleep through tediousness .
In two hours , Pauline wakened Julie : it was dinner time.

They sat down alone without Serge, who had gone to some
great dinner. Julie and Viérotchka again got hilarious, and
then again they grew serious ; when they bade each other
farewell they became entirely serious , and Julie thought of

asking - she had never had a chance to do so before why Viérotchka meant to establish a sewing shop. If she
wanted to make money, then it would be much easier if she
would become an actress, or a singer : she has such a strong
voice. This matter caused them to sit down again. Viérotchka began to describe her plan, and Julie again became
enthusiastic, and she poured out blessings, and, among other
things , she declared that she, Julie Le Tellier, was an

abandoned woman, and she wept, but she knew what virtue
was, and again she wept, and again she kissed her, and
again she broke out into blessings .

Four days later Julie came to Viéra Pavlovna and gave
her a good many orders for herself ; she gave her the addresses of a number of her friends , from whom she might

also receive orders.

She brought Serge along with her,

telling him that it could not be avoided : " Lopukhóf called

on me, and now you must return it." Julie behaved with


======================================================================

158

A VITAL QUESTION.

exemplary seriousness, and kept it up without the least
failure, although she stayed at the Lopukhófs' a long time .
She saw that there were no thick walls, but thin partitions ,

and that her remarks might be overheard. She did not get
excited, but she fell rather into a bucolic frame of mind,
looking with delight at all the particulars of the poor estate
of the Lopukhofs' , and finding that that was the way to live ;

that men ought not to live otherwise ; that only in moderate
circumstances is true happiness possible, and she even
announced to Serge that she would go with him to live
in Switzerland, where they would have a little house amid
the fields and mountains, on the shore of a lake, loving
each other, fishing, taking care of their garden.

Serge

declared that he was perfectly ready, but he wanted to
wait and see what she would say at the end of three or
four hours .

The thunder of the elegant carriage, and the prancing of
Julie's wonderful horses , made a startling impression on the
inhabitants of the fifth block, between the Middle and the

Little Prospekts , where nothing of the sort had been seen , at
least since the time of Peter the Great, if not longer. Many
eyes were looking as the wonderful phenomenon stopped at
the locked gates of a one-storied, frame building, with its
seven windows, and when from the wonderful carriage
stepped the still more wonderful phenomenon of an elegant
lady, with a brilliant officer, whose important position could
not be doubted.

The grief was general, when in a moment

the gates were opened, and the carriage rolled into the dvor ;
curiosity was deprived of the hope of seeing the graceful
officer, and still more graceful lady, a second time, when
they took their departure. When Daniluitch returned home
from his peddling, Petrovna had a talk with him :
" Daniluitch , well our tenants must be from among very
important folks .

A general and a generálsha came to see

them. The generálsha was dressed so elegant that I can't
begin to tell you ; and the general had two stars ! "
How Petrovna came to see the stars on Serge, who had
never had any decorations, and would not have worn them
if he had had them, while out on service with Julie, is a

wonderful circumstance ; but that she actually saw them ;
that she was not mistaken , and did not exaggerate, for this

I will not take her word ; but I will myself be responsible for
her : she did actually see them. It is we who know that he


======================================================================

A VITAL QUESTION.

159

did not have them ; but he had such an appearance, that

from Petrovna's standpoint, it was impossible not to see two
stars on him, - and so she saw them ; I am not joking
when I tell you that she really saw them.
" And what livery the lackey wore, Daniluitch ! Real
English stuff, five rubles an arshín ; such a solemn man he
was, and so important, but just as perlite as could be ; he
give me a civil answer ; he allowed me to feel of his sleeve ;

elegant cloth. They seem to have so much money that they
feed it out to their chickens. And they sat in our tenants'
rooms , Daniluitch, and talked with them cosily, for more'n
two hours, just as I talk with you, and them tenants did not
even bow to them, and they were joking with them, and the
tenant was sitting with the general, both of them sitting comfortably on the chair, and they were smoking ! and our tenant

smoked right in the general's face, and he sat comfortably
before him ! what else ? His cigarette went out, and then
he lighted it at the general's ! And with what grace the
general kissed our lady's little hand ! why, I can't begin to
tell you ! What can we make out of this, Daniluitch ? "
"Everything is from God, is the way I reason it ; I reckon
that whether it's acquaintance or relation, it's all from
God."

" So it is , Daniluitch ; there's no doubt about it ; but this
is what I think

that either our tenant or his wife are either

a brother or a sister of either the general or the generalsha .
And, to tell you the truth, I think that she must be the general's sister."

"What makes you think so, Petrovna ? It don't seem
natural.

If it was so, then they'd have money ."

" That's a fact, Daniluitch. It must be this way : either
the mother or the father had a natural child ; because they

don't favor each other. Really, there ain't no resemblance
'tall."

" That may be, Petrovna ; perhaps there was a natural
child. Such things do happen."
Petrovna, for four whole days, enjoyed great importance
in her little store. This little store for three whole days drew
a part of the public from the store on the other side of the

street. Petrovna, for the sake of enlightening the public
during these days , even neglected her work to a certain ex

tent, and slaked the thirst of those who were thirsting for
knowledge.
The result of all this was that within a week Pavel Kon-

stantinuitch came to see his daughter and son-in-law .
Marya Alekséyevna had been anxious to gather some information about the lives led by her daughter and the “ villain." It was not done systematically or constantly, and,
for the most part, it arose from a scientific instinct of curiosity. One of her little gossiping acquaintances, who lived
on the Vasilyevsky Island , was entrusted with the task of
finding out about Viéra Pavlovna, whenever she happened to
pass by where she lived ; and the gossip brought her reports ,
as often as once a month, or even oftener, according to circumstances . " The Lopukhófs live in harmony ; they have no
quarrels ; there's only one thing : there are a good many young
folks call on them, and all the young men are good friends
and modest. They do not live luxuriously ; but apparently
they have money. They not only do not sell; but they buy.
She has made herself two silk dresses .

They have bought

two sofas, an oblong table, a half a dozen chairs , - they got
them at a bargain, for forty rubles ; but the furniture is good,
and it would ordinarily cost a hundred rubles. They have
notified the landlord to look for new tenants. We are going
to leave in about a month for our new quarters ; and to you,'
-that is , the landlord , - we are very grateful for your kindness to us .' ' Nu ! ' say the landlord ; of course,' says he ;
' and we for yours . "

Marya Alekséyevna was consoled by these reports. Though
she was a very rough and a very wicked woman, though she
had tormented her daughter and was ready to kill her, to ruin
her for her own interests, and though she cursed her, because ,

through her, she had failed in her plan of getting rich,

all

this is true ; but does it follow from this that she felt no love

for her daughter ? It does not follow at all. When the matter was ended, when her daughter tore herself away from her
power forever, what could she do ? Whatever falls from the

wagon is lost.

For all that, she is her daughter ; and now,

when there was no chance whatsoever for Viéra Pavlovna to

serve Marya Alekséyevna's interests, the mother sincerely
wished her daughter good. And then, again, it does not
follow that she would wish things to be God-knows-how, that
it made no difference with her ; she certainly had not sub-

jected her to any system of espionage. The steps taken for

watching her daughter were only adopted because she, you
must confess , was morally obliged to watch her ; well, and
in exactly the same way, as regards the wishes for her good,

she had to do it, because she was her daughter. Why shouldn't
she be reconciled ?

All the more when the villanous son-in-

law is , according to all appearances , a man of solid charac-

ter. Maybe he will be of service in time. Thus Marya
Alekséyevna, little by little, approached the thought of renewing her relations with her daughter. It might have to
wait half a year, or even a year , to accomplish it ; but there
was no need of being in a hurry ; time is patient. But the

news about the general and the generálsha at once pushed the
story forward, fully all the remainder of the last half way.
The villain has really proved to be a rogue. An ex-student
(studentishka ) , without rank, with only a few rubles, he has
made friends with a young, and therefore a very important,
and rich general, and the two wives have become acquainted.
Such a man will get ahead ! Or even , may be, Viéra made
friends with the generálsha, and introduced her husband to

the general ; it is all the same . At all events, Viéra will get
on.

And so, soon after getting the news of the famous visit,

the father was sent to announce to the daughter that her
mother had forgiven her, and would be glad to see her.
Viéra Pavlovna went with Pavel Konstantinuitch and her

husband, and they spent the early part of the evening there .
The meeting was cold and constrained. They spoke much
about Feódor, because it was not a dangerous subject. He had
gone to the gymnasium ; they persuaded Marya Alekséyevna
to put him into the gymnasium boarding-school. Dmitri Sergéitch would visit him there, and during his holidays Viéra
Pavlovna would take him home with her.

Somehow or other

they managed to spend the time until tea was ready, and then
they made haste to leave. The Lopukhófs said that they
expected callers .
For half a year Viéra Pavlovna had breathed pure air ; her

lungs had entirely forgotten the bad atmosphere of wily words ,
vile thoughts , low schemes , all for the sake of lucre , and her

cellar made a horrible impression upon her. Filth, misery,
vulgarity of every sort,- everything came up before her eyes
with the keenness of a novelty.
" How did I ever have the strength to live in such miserable bonds ?

How could I ever breathe in that cellar ?

And


======================================================================

162

A VITAL QUESTION.

I not only lived and breathed there, but even grew strong
and well ! It is wonderful ! it is incomprehensible ! How
could I grow up there into a love for goodness ? It is incom-

prehensible !

It is beyond belief ! " thought Viéra Pavlovna,

as she returned home ; and she felt herself rescued from
suffocation .

In a little while after they got home, the guests whom
they expected came, their regular cronies ,-Aleksei Petróvitch, and Natalia Andreyevna, and Kirsánof ; and the
evening passed as it usually did. How doubly happy seemed
her new life to Viéra Pavlovna, with its pure thoughts, in
the society of wholesome people ! As was customary , they

had a jolly conversation, with many anecdotes, and at the
same time they talked seriously about everything in the
world : on the historical events of the time (the civil war in
Kansas, the forerunner of the great war between the North
and the South, which is now going on, the forerunner of still
greater events, not in America alone , occupied the minds of

this circle. Now everybody talks about politics, but then,
only a few felt any interest in this subject, and in this small
number, were Lopukhóf, Kirsánof and their friends) ; and they
talked about the arguments of that day, as to the chemical
foundations of agriculture according to the theory of Liebig ,
and about the laws of historical progress , without which never
a conversation in society like this could go on ; and about the
great importance of distinguishing between real desires,
which search , and seek, and find satisfaction for themselves ;
and fantastic wishes, which cannot be realized, and which
cannot find any satisfaction, like the fantastic thirst in time

of fever, for which, for the one, as well as for the other, there
is one satisfaction , -to cure the organism, by whose dis-

eased state they are engendered through the disfiguring of
actual wishes and finally , about the importance of this radical differentiation which was brought out at that time by the
anthropological philosophy, and about everything of this sort ,
and not of this sort, but allied.

The ladies at times listened

to these scientific discussions, which were spoken as though
there were no scientific terms , and took a share asking questions sometimes , but more often not waiting for the answers ;

and they have even thrown cold water on Lopukhóf and
Alekséi Petrovitch, when they get too much interested in
the great importance of recent mineral improvements : but
Alekséi Petróvitch and Lopukhóf discussed their scientific

questions, and were not disturbed. Kirsánof was a bad helpmeet ; he was more ; even entirely, on the side of the ladies ,
and they all three played, sang, laughed, till late into the
night, and then, becoming tired, they finally separated, even
the immovable enthusiasts for serious conversation .

III .

VIÉRA PAVLOVNA'S SECOND DREAM.

And here Viéra Pavlovna falls asleep, and Viéra Pavlovna
dreams a dream .

A field, and across the field goes a man, namely, her
milenki, together with Alekséi Petróvitch, and her milenki
says : " You are interested in knowing why some dirt brings
forth wheat so white, and pure, and delicate, while other
dirt does not bring it forth at all. You will soon see the
difference yourself. Look at the root of this beautiful ear
of wheat. Around the root is dirt, but this dirt is just
pulled up, you might even call it clean ; you smell a moist

odor, disagreeable, but not foul, and not putrid. You know
that in the philosophical language which you and I use, this
clean dirt is called actual dirt. It is dirt, to be sure ; but look

at it attentively and you will see that all the elements of
which it is composed are healthy in themselves .

When they

are gathered together, they make dirt ; but let the atoms
change in some degree their relative co-ordination, and something else will take its place, and all that takes its place will
be healthy , because the fundamental elements are healthy.
Whence comes the healthy element of this dirt ? Just
notice the situation of this little field : you see that there is
a ditch here for the water to run, and therefore there can
be no rottenness here ."

" Yes , motion is reality," says Alekséi Petrovitch, “ be-

cause motion is life ; and reality and life are one and the
same thing.

But the main element of life is labor, and

therefore, the main element of reality is labor, and the
truest sign of reality is activity. "

" So you see, Alekséi Petrovitch, when the sun begins to
warm this dirt, and the warmth begins to transfer its elements into a more complicated chemical correlation , into the
correlation of higher forms , the wheat ear which grows out of


======================================================================

A VITAL QUESTION.

this dirt through the warmth of the sun will be a healthy
wheat ear. "

" Yes , it is because it is the soil of actual life, Alekséi
Petrovitch ."

" Now let us go to the next field ; let us also here pull up
a plant, and examine its root. It is also dirty. But just
notice the nature of this dirt.

It is not hard to see that this

dirt is rotten."

" This is fantastic dirt, to use the scientific terminology,"
says Alekséi Petróvitch .

" It's so ; the elements of this dirt are in an unhealthy
state.

It is natural that no matter how they are transposed,

the things not resembling dirt, derived from this dirt will be
unhealthy and rotten."
" Yes ; it is because the very elements are unhealthy," says
Alekséi Petróvitch.
" It will not be hard for us to find the cause of this
uuhealthiness ."

" That is , of this fantastic rottenness ," says Alekséi Petróvitch.

" Yes, the rottenness of these elements ; if you will notice
the situation of this field, you see the water has no ditch,
and there it becomes stagnant and rotten . "
" Yes , absence of motion is absence of labor," says
Alekséi Petrovitch . " Because labor is shown in anthropo-

logical analysis to be the radical form of motion, and which
gives foundation and material for all other forms , -recrea-

tion, rest, amusement, gayety ; all these without the preliminary labor have no reality ;

and without motion,

there is no life, that is, there is no reality ; therefore,
this dirt is fantastic, in other words , rotten. Till within a
short time ago, men did not know how to restore health to
such fields ; but now means has been found ; that is , drainage .

The superfluous water runs off in canals, and enough remains,
and it is kept in motion, and the field becomes practicable.

But of long as this means is not applied, the dirt remains
ast , that is to say, rotten, and it cannot produce any
fantastisis ; whereas, as is very natural, from the good dirt
good crop od crops, because it is healthy dirt. And this is

" And you, Alekséi Petrovitch, have a desire to amuse
yourself with hog- Latin and syllogisms ," says her milenki ;
that is , her husband.

Viéra Pavlovna here seemed to join them and say, " Now
do stop talking about your analyses, identities, and anthropologisms . Please talk about something, gentlemen, so that
I may take part in your conversation ; or rather, let us play."

"Yes, let us play," said Alekséi Petróvitch. " Let us
play Confession. ' "

"Came on ! come on ! It'll be very gay," says Viéra
Pavlovna. " You suggested the game ; now you must show
us how to do it."

" With pleasure, my sister," says Alekséi Petróvitch.
"But how old are you, my dear sister ? eighteen ?"
" I shall soon be nineteen ."

" But you are not yet ; therefore, let us suppose that
you are eighteen, and we will all confess what we did till we
were eighteen, because we must have an equality of conditions. I will confess for myself and my wife. My father
was a diakon in a governmental town, and then he took up
the business of book-binding ; and my mother took seminarists to board. From morning till night my father and
mother were always worrying and talking about how to
live. Father used to drink , but only at times when intolerable want stared him in the face - that was real grief ; or ,

when his income was pretty good, he used to give my
mother all he had, and say, ' Well, mátushka, now thank
God, you will not suffer want for two months to come ; but
I have left half a ruble in my pocket, and I shall take a
drink for very joy ' - that was a real joy. My mother used
to get vexed very often. Sometimes she used to beat me ,
but only when she had a pain in the small of the back, as
she herself used to say, from lifting the boiler and kettles ,
from washing all the clothes of five of us besides five seminarists , and from washing the floors dirtied by our twenty
feet which did not wear galoshes , and from taking care of

the cow.

It is a real strain upon the nerves to bear too

much labor without rest. And for all that, the ends did not
used to meet , as she expressed it ; that is , she was short of
money for getting boots for some one of us brothers , or
shoes for the sisters .

Then she used to beat us .

She used

to pet us too, when we, stupid little children that we were,
expressed a desire to help her in her work, or whenever we

did anything clever, or whenever she took a very rare
moment of rest, and her back did not ache, as she used to
say all that was a real joy
‫دو‬

" Akh ! don't tell us anything more about your real sorrows and joys," says Viéra Pavlovna.
" If that is the case, perhaps you would like to hear
Natasha's confession ? "

" I do not want to hear it.

She, too , had the same kind

of real sorrows and joys, I am sure of it."
" That's absolutely true."

" But, maybe, you will be interested in hearing my confession," says Serge, who suddenly appeared to be with
them.

" We will see," says Viéra Pavlovna.

" My father and mother, though they were rich, yet they
always worried and talked about money. Rich people, too,
are not free from such kinds of worriment - ”

" You don't know how to play Confession,' Serge," said
Alekséi Petrovitch, politely. "Please tell me why they
worried about money matters ? What expenses worried
them ? What necessities put them into embarrassment ? "
" Yes , I understand why you ask that," said Serge ; " but
let us drop this subject. Let us turn to the other view of
their thoughts . They, too , took care of their children. "

" But they always had enough to give their children, didn't
they ? " asked Alekséi Petróvitch .

" Of course ; but they had to look out that— "
"Don't play ' Confession,' Serge," said Alekséi Petróvitch. " We know your whole story ; care about superfluities, thoughts about things not necessary, have been the soil
in which you grew up ; that is, a fantastic soil. Just look
at yourself ! You are naturally not at all a stupid man ,
but a very good man ; maybe not worse and not more
stupid than we are ; but what are you good for ? what is the
use of your living ? "
" I am good for escorting Julie everywhere that she wants
me to go. I help Julie to spend all the money she wants to
spend , " replies Serge .
" From this we see," says Alekséi Petrovitch , " that a
fantastic and unhealthy soil -"

" Akh ! how tired I am of your realism and fantasticism !

I don't know what they mean by such terms , and

still they keep on using them," says Viéra Pavlovna.

" Wouldn't you like to talk with me ? " asks Marya Alekséyevna, who also appeared suddenly. " You gentlemen get
away from here, for I want to talk with my daughter."
All disappear. Viérotchka finds herself alone with Marya
Alekséyevna. Marya Alekséyevna's face assumes a laughing expression .
" Viéra Pavlovna, you are an educated woman ; you are

so virtuous and high-toned," says Marya Alekséyevna, and
her voice trembles with anger ; " you are so kind ; how can
I then, who am rough and a drunkard, talk with you ? Viéra
Pavlovna, you have a bad and beastly mother ; but allow me
to ask, lady, why your mother took all the bother she did
for you ? It was about victuals. This , according to your
idea, is a genuine care peculiar to humanity ; isn't that so ?
You have had scoldings, you have seen bad deeds and
meanness ; but allow me to ask what they were meant for ?

Was it for nothing ? Was it all nonsense ? No, lady ; no
matter how things go in your family, it was not an empty,
fantastic life . You see, Viéra Pavlovna, I have learned to
speak as you do, in scientific language. But it may grieve
you and shame you, Viéra Pavlovna, that your mother is a
bad and ill-tempered woman? Would you like, Viéra
Pavlovna, for me to become a good and honest woman ? I
am an enchantress , Viéra Pavlovna ; I can bewitch things ;

I can fulfil your wish. Just look, Viéra Pavlovna ! your
wish is already being fulfilled. I, who am vixenish, vanish.
Look at this kind mother and her daughter ! "
A room. On the door-sill snores a drunken, unshaven,
miserable man . Who it is cannot be told ; his face is half
covered with his hand, and the rest is discolored and bruised.

A bed. On the bed a woman ; yes , it is Marya Alekséyevna ;
but how kind, but how pale she is ! how feeble, though she is
only forty-five years old ! how exhausted ! By the bedside is
a young girl of eighteen. " It is I myself, Viérotchka ; but
how ragged I seem ! What does this mean ? my complexion
is so yellow, and my features are so rough ! and what a
miserable chamber ! Scarcely any furniture ! "
"Viérotchka, my dear, my angel, " says Marya Alekséyevna ,
" just lie down and take a rest, my treasure. Why do you
watch with me ? I can attend to myself. This is the third
night that you have not slept."
" Never mind ; I am not tired," says Viérotchka.

" I am not any better, Viérotchka. How will you get along

without me ? Your father's pittance is as small as it can

be, and he himself is a poor support to you. You are a pretty
girl. There are many bad people in this world. There will
be no one to watch over you. I tremble for you." Viérotchka weeps .

" My dear, don't be grieved ; I am telling you this, not
to blame you, but to warn you.

What made you leave home

" He will deceive you, Viérotchka. Give him up. "
" No, mámenka. "

Two months pass. How is it that two months pass in one

the officer is a bottle. On the officer's knees is she, Viérotchka .

Again two months more have passed in one minute.
A lady is sitting. Before the lady she, Viérotchka, is
standing.

" Can you iron, dear ? "
" I can ."

" To what class do you belong ? Are you a serf or free ? "
" My father was a tchinovnik. ” 1

" So you belong to the nobility, my dear ? Then I can't
take you. What kind of a servant would you make ? Go
away, my dear ; I can't take you."
Viérotchka is on the street .

" Mademoiselle ! ho, mademoiselle ! " says some young
drunken fellow, accosting her. " Where are you going ?

Viérotchka runs to the Neva.

" Yes ," says Viérotchka ; and she trembles .
" Have you seen, have you heard, what's going on ? "
" Yes ."

" Do they live well, them learned folks ? Do they read
books , and think as you do about your new plan for folks
getting along better ? Do they ? Tell me ! "
Viérotchka says nothing, but she trembles .

" Ek ! there ain't nothing to be got out of you. Do they
live well ? Hear my question ! "
Viérotchka says nothing, but she is in a cold sweat.
" One can't git a word out of you ! Do they live well ? I
ask you. Are they good ? I ask you. Would you like to be like
them? You don't speak ! You turn away your phiz ! Just
listen, Viérotchka, to what I am going to say ! You are
educated ; you are educated on money that I stole. You are
thinking about the good ; but if I had not been bad, you would
not have even known what good is. Do you understand ?
You owe ALL to me. You are my daughter. Do you understand ? I am your mother ! "
Viérotchka weeps and trembles, and is in a cold sweat.

" Mámenka, what do you want of me ? I cannot love you."
" Do I ask you to love me ? "
" I should like at least to respect you ; but I cannot do that,
either ."

" Do I need your respect ? "
" What do you want, then, mámenka ? Why have you
come to me, and why do you speak so harshly to me ? What
do you want of me ? "

" Be grateful , you selfish girl ! Do not love, do not respect

why should you respect me ? But you understand, Viérka,

The bride of her bridegrooms, the sister of her sisters , takes

Viérotchka by the hand. * Viérotchka, I always wanted to
be kind to you because I am kind and I am just as the person

see I too am melancholy. Look ! do I make a good appearance being melancholy ? "
" You look better than any one else in the world."

" Kiss me, Viérotchka.

We both of us are sad ; and yet

your mother spoke the truth.
I need her help."

I do not like your mother, but

" Can't you get along without her ? "
"By and by I shall be able to get along without her, when
people will not need to be ill-tempered ; but now it is impossible. You see, kind people cannot get to their feet alone.
It is the ill-tempered who alone are strong. They are keen .

But you see, Viérotchka, that there are different degrees of
ill-temper : some of them want everything in the world to go
to the bad ; others, who are just as ill-tempered, want things
to improve , because it would be better for their interests .
You see it was necessary for your mother's plans to have you

educated. She took your money which you got by giving
lessons, because she wanted her daughter to capture a rich
son- in-law for her ; and for that same reason she wanted you
to be educated. You see she had bad thoughts, and yet they
brought forth good for mankind. Haven't you been benefited? But many bad people act otherwise. If your mother
had been Anna Petrovna, would you have studied so as to
become educated ? Would you have learned what was good,

and loved it ? No ; you would not have been allowed to learn
about the good ; you would have been made a doll. Isn't it
so ? Such a mother must have a doll in her daughter, because

she herself is a doll, and she is always playing dolls with
dolls. But your mother was a bad woman ; yet she was a
character. It was necessary for her that you should not be a
doll. Don't you see how the wicked vary ? Others are hindering me , because I want men to be men, and not dolls ;
they want men to be dolls. And other bad people are help-

ing me.

They do not consciously help me, but they give

ample chance for men to be men ; they gather the means for
men to be men, and this is all that I want . Yes , Viérotchka,

her, you would not have been ! "
" And will it always be so, or will it change ? "
" No, Viérotchka, it will not always be so ; it will change
by and by. When the kind become strong, I shall not need
the ill-tempered ; and this will be soon, Viérotchka. Then
the bad will see that it is impossible for them to be bad ; and

those ill-tempered who had any character will become kind.
They were ill-tempered only because it was contrary to their
interests to be kind ; because they know that goodness is
better than badness . They will begin to love it when it will
be possible for them to love it without injuring their
interests ."

" And what will become of the bad who were dolls ?

I

feel sorry for them , too ! "
They will play with other kinds of dolls, only they will be
harmless dolls. But they will have children different from
what they themselves are, because I will make all men to be

men, and I shall teach their children not to be dolls , but
men."

" Akh ! how good that will be ! "

" Yes, even now it is good, because this good is in preparation ; at least, those who, helping to bring it about, are
already enjoying it. When you , Viérotchka, help your cook

to get your dinner ready, it may be suffocating in the kitchen,
but it is good for you. What do you care for the gas and

IV .

VIÉRA PAVLOVNA's sewing union was established. The
foundations were very simple at first, - so simple, indeed ,
that it is not worth while to speak of them. Viéra Pavlovna
did not make any rules at all for her first three seamstresses ,

except that she would pay them a trifle more than the regular seamstresses were getting at the shops . There was nothing particularly strange about the business ; the seamstresses
saw that Viéra Pavlovna was not a woman of mere words ,

not fickle ; and therefore, without any hesitation they accepted her offer to work with her. There was no reason for
hesitation in the fact that a woman of moderate means

wanted to establish a sewing shop. These three girls found
three or four more .

They selected them with the same care

with which Viéra Pavlovna proposed to them, and in these
conditions of choice there was nothing worthy of suspicion ;
that is, there was nothing out of the ordinary run about

it.

A young and modest woman wishes the working girls

in her establishment to be girls of straightforward character,

kind , considerate, inclined to stay in one place ; is there
anything strange about that ? She does not want any quarrels , that's all ; and therefore it's clever of her, and nothing

more . Viéra Pavlovna made acquaintance with these chosen

girls ; she became very well acquainted with them before
she agreed to accept them ; that was natural. It shows that
she is a woman of sound common sense, and that's all.

There is nothing to deliberate about ; there is nothing to
distrust.

Thus they worked a month, receiving in due time the
wages which had been agreed upon. Viéra Pavlovna was
constantly at the shop, and they learned to look upon her as
an economical , careful, and reasonable woman, with unusual
consideration for them, and thus she won their full confi-

dence. The was nothing extraordinary about that either,
nor was anything noticeable except that the mistress was a
good mistress, in whose hands the business would succeed ;
she knows how to manage.
But at the end of a month Viéra Pavlovna came into the

shop one day with some kind of an account-book ; she asked
her seamstresses to stop work, and listen to what she had to
say .

She began to speak, in very simple language, things which
were comprehensible, very comprehensible, but which her
seamstresses had never heard before, either from her or
from anybody else.
" Now that we know each other well," she began, " I can
say of you that you are good workers and good girls. And
you will not say that I am a fool. Consequently I can speak
with you frankly about my ideas. If you should find anything strange in them, you will think carefully about them,
and not insist that my ideas are foolish, because you know
that I am not a foolish woman. This is the plan that I
propose :

"Good people say that it is possible to establish sewing
shops where seamstresses might work to much greater profit
to themselves than in those shops that we know about. And

so I wanted to make an experiment. Judging by the first
month , it appears that it can be done.

You have been re-

ceiving your wages regularly, and now I want to tell you
how much over and above your wages and all other expenses
remain in my hands as clear profit."
Viéra Pavlovna read over to them the debit and credit

account for the month. In the expense account were reckoned, besides the wages paid, all other expenses . - the

rent of the shop, light, even down to Viéra Pavlovna's

charges for an izvoshchik, which she hired in the interests of
the shop, and cost about a ruble.

" You see," she continued, " there remains in my hands
so much money. Now what am I going to do with it ? I
have established this sewing shop with the express purpose
of letting the profits go to the very seamstresses by whose

work it was earned. Therefore, I am going to divide it
among you . This first time, all of you will get an equal
share ; each one of you her own. By and by we can see
whether we cannot manage it better, or whether there isn't

some other way that will not be still more profitable for you. "
She divided the money.
For some time the seamstresses could not believe their

senses , so great was their surprise ; then they began to pour
out their thanks . Viéra Pavlovna gave them sufficient time to
express their gratitude for the division of the money, so that
she might not hurt their feelings, by refusing to listen, for
that would have looked like indifference to their opinions
and inclinations ; then she continued :

" Now I must explain to you the hardest question of all ;

it will be sure to arise, and I do not know as I shall be able
to make it plain to you. Yet I must speak about it. Why
didn't I keep the money, and what was my design in establishing the shop, if I did not intend to profit from the advan-

tage arising from it ? I live with my husband, as you know,
and have a sufficiency : we are not rich, but we have all that
we need. If I am in need of anything, all I have to do
would be to ask my husband for it ; and I should not even
have to ask him, for he would see that I was in want of more

money, and I should have it. He does not spend his time
now in doing those things which bring him in most money,
but in those things which he likes best. And as we love
each other dearly, it pleases him most of all to do those
things which I like, and it is the same with me. Therefore,
if I should be short of money, he would undertake some
business which would be more profitable than his present
occupation, and he is able to find such a business , because

he is a clever and an able man ; but you have some idea
of him, and the fact that he does not do so, is proof
positive that the money which we both have is enough for us
both. This is because I have no great hankering after
money , for you know that different people have different

desires, and not all care for money ; some hanker after

are ready to ruin themselves for the sake of their passion,

and a good many do ruin themselves, and no one is surprised
that their passion is dearer to them than money . And my
hobby happens to be this thing which I am trying to arrange
with you, and I not only do not ruin myself for the sake of my
hobby, but I do not even spend any money on it ; I am only
too glad to give up some of my time to it, and do not take
any of the profit for myself. Well, now, according to my
idea, there is nothing strange about this ; for who expects to
make any money out of his pet hobby ? Everybody else
even goes to expense for the sake of gratifying it, but I do
not do that ; I do not put any money out. Consequently, the
advantage lies on my side, compared with others ; for I ride
my hobby and get pleasure out of it, without any loss to
myself ; whereas, others have to spend money for their
pleasures. And why is it that I have this hobby ? This is
the reason : Kind and clever people have written many
books about the way men should get along in this world ;
how all should have the chance to enjoy life, and our principal way, they say, consists in starting shops according to
a new system. And so I want to see for myself whether we
shall be able to start such a system as is needed. It is just
the same as when one man wants to build a fine house ,
another, to plant a splendid garden, or orangery, so as to
get pleasure out of them ; so do I want to start a fine sewing
shop , so that I may have pleasure in it.

" Of course, it would have been satisfactory enough, if I
were to divide the profits among you every month, as I have

just done ; but clever people say that there is still a better
way of doing it, so that there should be more profits , and the
profits themselves should be used to much better advantage. They say that this can be very easily done. Now,
we shall see. I shall tell you, by degrees, what can be done,
according to the ideas of clever people ; and if you yourselves will take notice, as you look on, and anything which
promises well suggests itself to you, we can try to do it,
little by little, according to circumstances. But I must
confess to you, that without your aid, I cannot take this

new step.

thing will go on in the old way, unless you yourselves want
to make a change. Without your own wish, nothing can be
done .

" And now, this is my last order, as mistress of the shop,
without your advice. You see that accounts must be kept,
and care must be taken that there are no unnecessary
expenses . Last month I managed the business myself, but
henceforth , I do not want to take charge of it.

of your number to act in concert with me. I will not do
anything without them. It is your money, and not mine ;
therefore , you must look after it. As yet, the thing is an
experiment. It has not yet been shown who among you is
most capable of managing it ; so, for the time being, those
who are selected must serve for only a short term , and in a

week you will find out whether it will be necessary to select
others , or leave the former in their places . "

Long discussions were awakened by these unusual words .
But Viéra Pavlovna had already gained their confidence, and
she spoke so simply, not going too far in advance, not
conjuring up any extraordinary prospects , which, after a
moment's enthusiasm, would fade away into distrust, that
the girls did not look upon her as a lunatic, and that was all

that was required, - that she should not be regarded as a
lunatic. The experiment progressed slowly.
Of course it progressed slowly. Here is a short history
of the shop for the first three years, during which it played
the principal part in the life of Viéra Pavlovna herself.
The girls who at first made up the personelle of the new

shop were carefully selected ; they were good seamstresses ;
they were directly interested in the success of the scheme ;

therefore, it was natural that the work went on successfully.
The shop never lost any of its customers who once entrusted

it with orders . There was some envy manifested on the part
of several shops and factories, but it did not produce the
least effect except to oblige Viéra Pavlovna to take out a
license to display a sign , so that there might not be any
chicanery. Soon more orders began to come in than the
girls who at first made up the union were able to fill, and thus
they were obliged gradually to increase their numbers. At

the end of a year and a half there were twenty girls in the
union , and after that still more .

One of the first results of giving a decisive voice to the
entire shop in the management of its business was a decision


======================================================================

A VITAL QUESTION.

177

which might have been expected : in the very first month of
their regime the girls decided that it would not do for Viéra

Pavlovna to work without pay. When they announced this
decision to her, she said that they were right. They wanted
to give her the third part of the profits ; she laid it aside for
some time before she ventured to explain to them that it was

diametrically opposed to the fundamental idea of their
scheme. For some time they could not understand this ;
then afterwards they came to the conclusion that Viéra Pav-

lovna refused a special share of the profits, not from selfconceit, but from the nature of the experiment itself. By
this time the shop had expanded to such dimensions that

Viéra Pavlovna by herself was not able to attend to all the
cutting, and so she had to get an assistant. They gave Viéra
Pavlovna the same wages as the other cutter. The money
which she had been laying aside was now, by her request,
taken back into the common fund, with the exception of
what was due her for her work as cutter ; the balance was

employed in the establishment of a bank. For about a year
Viéra Pavlovna spent the larger part of each day at the
shop, and really worked as hard as any one else, according
to the schedule of hours. When she saw the possibility of
spending less time in the shop than a whole day, her wages
were reduced in proportion.
How should the profits be divided ? Viéra Pavlovna wanted
to bring it about that the profits should be divided equally
among them all.

They consented to this only towards the

middle of the third year ; before that time they tried several
different schemes. At first they divided the profits proportionally according to the wages earned by each ; then they
came to the conclusion that if a girl missed work for a few
days on account of illness or any other important reason , it
would not be fair to reduce her share of the division money,

which , properly speaking, had not been gained during those
few days , but by the general course of the work and the general state of the shop. Then they went a step further, and
agreed that the cutters and other girls who received extra
wages, by delivering orders and other duties, were already
sufficiently paid by their extra wages , and that therefore it
would be unfair for them to get proportionally more than

the others also in their share of the profits. The ordinary
seamstresses who had no extra duties were so modest that

they did not ask for any charge, although they saw the in


======================================================================

178

A VITAL QUESTION.

justice of the other arrangement, which was due to their own
vote ; the others who had this extra compensation felt the

awkwardness of availing themselves of the extra division,
and when they once came into the spirit of the scheme, they
entirely refused it. It is necessary , however, to remark that
this temporary modesty, the patience of the ones and the refusal of the others , was not a remarkable step, taking into
the consideration the constant improvement in the affairs of
both sides . The most difficult task of all was to develop the
idea that the ordinary seamstresses were all entitled to an

equal share in the profits, notwithstanding the fact that some
of them were earning more wages than others ; that seam-

stresses who were working more successfully than others were
already sufficiently compensated for the success of their work
by getting better wages. The last change in the way of
dividing the profits was accomplished in the middle of the
third year after the shop girls understood that the receiving
of the profits was not the reward for the art of one or two of

their number, but the result of the general character of the
shop, the result of its arrangement, its aim, - and this aim
meant equality, so far as was possible, in the profits, for all
participating in the work without regard to their personal
peculiarities , that upon this character of the union depended
the participation of the workers in the profits ; but the character of the union, its spirit, its arrangement, consisted in
the participation of all ; and for this participation of all every
member was a necessary factor.

The silent acquiescence of

the most hesitating and of the least gifted is no less beneficial for the preservation and development of the scheme, no
less profitable for all of them, and for the success of the

whole enterprise, than the active zeal of the most lively and
gifted.

I omit a good many details because I am not describing the workshop, but I simply enter into it with sufficient fulness to illustrate Viéra Pavlovna's activity. If I
mention some details, it is only because I wanted to show how
Viéra Pavlovna acted ;

how she conducted the business

step by step, patiently and tirelessly, and how firmly she kept
up to her rule not to show her hand as mistress , but to explain, to advise, to plan, to offer her assistance, to bring to
a successful issue the decision of her co-operatives .
The profits were divided every month ; at first each girl

took her share and spent it separately apart from the others ;


======================================================================

A VITAL QUESTION.

179

each one had immediate necessities , and they were not in the
habit of acting together. But when after constantly participating in the business, they had acquired the habit of understanding the entire procedure of the work in the shop, Viéra
Pavlovna turned their attention to the fact that in their busi-

ness the quantity of orders varied in different months of the
year, and that therefore it would be advisable, during the
most profitable months, to put away a portion of their profits
against those months when the profits were not so great.
The accounts were kept with great accuracy ; the girls knew
that if any one of them left the shop, she would get with-

out any difficulty her share of the earnings remaining in the
depository ; therefore they consented to accede to this plan.
A small reserve capital was established ; it gradually grew ;
they began to look for various ways of applying it. From
the very first, all understood that this reserve capital could
be drawn upon in the way of loans by those members who
had any extraordinary need of money, and that no interest
would be charged for its use. Poor people have the idea
that respectable help in money ought to be given without interest.

After this bank was established, there followed a

commission house for purchases ; the girls found it more
profitable to buy tea, coffee, sugar, foot wear, and many other
things through this shop, as it bought goods not at retail but
at wholesale, consequently cheaper. From this in a short
time they branched out still further ; they began to understand that it might also be possible to arrange for the purchase
of the bread and provisions which they used to buy every
day from the bakers and retail shops. But here they saw
that to do this they must live in one neighborhood ; they began to gather into circles, each circle occupying one suite,
and they tried to get quarters near the shop ; then the shop
had to establish its agency to transact business with the
bakeries and the stores. In a year and a half or so, almost
all the girls were living in one large apartment, had one
general table, and purchased their provisions in exactly the
same way as is done in great establishments .
Half of the girls were lonely souls. Some of them had old
women as relatives , mothers , or aunts ; two supported aged
fathers , and a good many had little brothers and sisters . On

account of these family relationships three of the girls could
not live in the general apartment : one of them had a mother

whom it was impossible to get along with ; the second had a


======================================================================

180

A VITAL QUESTION.

mother who was a tchinóvnitsa, and did not want to live with

peasant girls ; the third had a drunken father.

These only

made use of the agency just the same as those seamstresses

did who were not girls , but married women. But, apart
from these three, all the other girls who had relatives to support lived in the general apartment. They lived by themselves in one suite , two or three in one room ; but their male

or female relatives were given rooms according to circumstances . Two old ones had separate rooms ; all the other
old women lived together. For the little boys there was a

separate room, and two others for the little girls. It was
decided that the little boys could stay until they were eight
years old ; those above that age would be put out to learn a
trade .

There was an accurate account kept of everything, in order
that the whole association might get used to the idea that no

one was getting any advantage over anybody else, that they
were not doing each other any harm.

The accounts of the

single girls in the apartment for rooms and board were very
simple. After some hesitation, they decided to charge for a
brother or sister, under eight years of age, the fourth part of

the expenses of a grown-up girl, and that then the support
of a girl until she was twelve was to be reckoned at one-third ;
after she was twelve, the price should be one-half of that of

her sister. When the little girls should reach the age of thirteen, they should enter the shop as apprentices, if they did
not succeed in establishing themselves otherwise ; and it was
decided that from sixteen and upwards they should enter as
full members of the union, provided they were found to be
skilful seamstresses .

For the support of the grown-up rela-

tives, as much, of course, was charged as for that of the
seamstresses : for separate rooms there was an extra charge.

Almost all the old women, and the three old men, who lived in
the union apartment, busied themselves in the kitchen and in
other domestic duties, and for this, of course, they were paid.
All this can be told very quickly in words, and in reality
it seemed very easy, simple, and natural, when it was once
accomplished. But everything was done very deliberately,
and every new step cost a great many arguments, and every
change was the result of a whole series of experiments. It
would be very tedious and dry to describe the other details
of the shop as particularly as we have told about the division
of the profits. In regard to many points it is not necessary


======================================================================

A VITAL QUESTION.

181

to speak at all, lest we should weary the reader ; but we
must briefly mention one or two other things. For instance,
that the union had its agency
acy for selling ready-made clothing, which was made at the time when they were not busy
with orders. A separate store they could not as yet accomplish ; but they made arrangements with one of the shops in
the Gostinui Dvor. They established a little shop in the
Pushing Market ; two of the old women took charge of this

little shop.

But it is necessary to speak with a little more

fulness about one side of the life of the union.

Viéra Pavlovna, from the very first, began to bring them
books. After she had given her directions she began to read
aloud. She would read half an hour, or an hour, if she
were not interrupted by the necessity of giving out new work.

Then the girls took a rest from listening ; then followed some
more reading, and another rest. It is hardly worth mentioning that the girls, from the very first, became interested in
the reading ; some of them had been fond of it even before.

In two or three weeks, the reading during the working hours
took the form of a regular course .

In three or four months ,

two or three good readers were found, who were delegated to
relieve Viéra Pavlovna, to read half an hour ; and this halfhour was reckoned as regular work. When the duty of read-

ing aloud was taken from Viéra Pavlovna, Viéra Pavlovna,
who even before used to vary the monotony of reading by
telling stories, began to speak oftener and more at length ;
then her stories turned into a channel resembling elementary
courses in various branches of knowledge. Afterwards and this was a very great step -Viéra Pavlovna saw the
possibility of introducing a regular course of instruction. The
girls became so ambitious to learn, and their work went on
so successfully, that they decided to take , during their working day before dinner, a long rest for hearing the lessons .
" Alekséi Petrovitch," said Viéra Petrovitch once , while
she was at the Mertsálofs , " I have a favor that I want to

ask of you. Natasha is already on my side. My sewing
union is becoming a ‫و‬lyceum
for all possible knowledge. Be
‫د‬
one of its professors. "
" Well, what shall I teach? Latin or Greek or logic or
rhetoric ? " said Alekséi Petrovitch, laughing . " My specialty would not be very interesting, according to your opinion , and the opinion of another man whom you know. "
" Yes, you are needed, just because you are a specialist.


======================================================================

182

A VITAL QUESTION.

You must serve as the buckler of morality and the special
direction of our science ."
" That's true. I see that without me there would be no

morality. Give me a professorship."
" For instance, Russian history or international history."
" Capital ! But I will read this subject up, and I shall be
taken as a specialist. Excellent ! Two occupations, to
be a professor and a buckler."
Natalia Andréyevna, Lopukhóf, two or three students,
and Viéra Pavlovna herself were the other professors, as
they called themselves in jest.
Together with the course of instructions, they also arranged for amusements. They had evening parties ; they
had picnics out of town, -at first rarely, but afterwards ,
when they had more money, more frequently ; they took
boxes at the theatre. During the third winter they took ten
places in the parquet circle during the Italian opera.
How delightful, how exciting this was to Viéra Pavlovna !
there was much labor and care, and she also had disappointments. The misfortune that befell one of the best girls in
the union powerfully affected not her alone, but the whole
shop. Sáshenka Pribuitkova, one of the three girls whom
Viéra Pavlovna herself found, was very handsome, and was
very modest. She was engaged to a good and kind young
man, who was a tchinovnik. Once, as she was walking on
the street rather late , some gentleman accosted her.

She

hastened her steps. He followed her, and caught her by the
arm. She snatched herself away from him and started to
run ; but by the motion of pulling away her arm, she hit his
chest , and on the pavement was heard the ring of the polite

gentleman's watch. The polite gentleman caught Sáshenka
with perfect self-possession, and with a feeling of legal right,
and cried out, " Robbery ! police ! " Two policemen came
and took Sáshenka to the station-house. Meantime, nothing
was known in the shop as to what had become of her, and
they could not imagine where she could be lost. On the
fourth day a kind soldier, attached to the station-house,
brought Viéra Pavlovna a note from Sáshenka. Lopukhóf
immediately went off to see about it.

He was treated in-

sultingly ; he gave them back in their own coin, and went
off to Serge. Serge and Julie had gone out of town to a

great picnic, and did not come back for two days. Two


======================================================================

A VITAL QUESTION.

183

hours after his return, one of the officials begged Sáshenka's
pardon, and went to beg her bridegroom's pardon into the
bargain. But he could not find the young man. The bridegroom had been to see Sáshenka the evening before at the
station, and having learned from the policemen who were
placed in charge of her the name of the dandy (frant) , went
to him, and challenged him to a duel. Before he was challenged, the dandy apologized for his mistake in a very insulting tone ; but after he had received the challenge, he burst
into a peal of laughter. The tchinovnik said, " Here , then,
you will not refuse this challenge," and slapped him in the
face ; the dandy seized a stick ; the tchinovnik hit him in
the chest ; the dandy fell to the ground, and his servants
hurried to the noise. The barin was picked up dead ; he
had been knocked violently to the floor, and struck his cheek

on the sharp corner of a table. The tchinovnik was put in
prison, a criminal suit was instituted, and no end could be
foreseen to this case .

What was the result ?

There was no

result ; only, from that time, it was sad to look at Sáshenka.
The shop had several other experiences ; not criminal like

this , but likewise not very gay. Very ordinary occurrences ,
such as cause girls long tears, and young or middle-aged
men not long but pleasant recreation. Viéra Pavlovna knew
that, according to the existing ideas and conditions, such
occurrences were unavoidable ; that young girls could not be
kept in perfect safety , either by their own care or by that
exercised by others. It is just the same way as it used to
be in old times, in regard to small-pox, before people learned
to get rid of it. Now, whoever suffers from small-pox , is
himself to blame, and much more, those near to him ; but
once it was otherwise : no one was to blame except the mis-

erable weather or the wretched town or village ; for the person suffering from small-pox probably carried the contagion
by not putting himself into quarantine, until he got well.
The same thing is true now of these stories. Some time in
the future people may get rid of this kind of small-pox also.
Means have been found for it ; but people are not yet ready
to adopt it, just as it took a long time , a very long time ,

for people to be willing to adopt preventatives against the
small-pox . Viéra Pavlovna knew that this miserable weather
was to be found mainly in cities and towns , and it gets victims even from the most careful hands : but this is a very

poor consolation, when you know only that " I am not to


======================================================================

184

A VITAL QUESTION.

blame, my dear, for your sorrow; nor are you to blame,
yourself." Nevertheless, every one of these ordinary occurrences caused Viéra Pavlovna much grief, and still more
labor. Sometimes it was necessary to look up the girls
in order to help them ; but more frequently there was no

need of hunting ; it was only necessary to help, to pacify,
to restore courage, to bring back self-respect, to reason, to
bid them cease weeping , - " If you stop doing so, you will
not need to weep ."
But her happiness was much more, oh , much more !
Everything was happiness , except these sorrows ; and these

sorrows were only exceptional and rare occurrences . To-day
or a half-year you may be sorry for one ; but at the same
time you are glad for all others ; and when two or three

weeks have passed, you may be glad for this one too.
Bright and gay was the ordinary course of the business , and
it filled Viéra Pavlovna's heart with constant happiness .
And if sometimes things went hard owing to these griefs ,

yet exceptionally happy circumstances compensated for them ;
and these arose oftener than her griefs ; for instance, they

succeeded in establishing the young sisters or brothers of
one or another of the girls ; on the third year two girls
passed their examinations as private teachers . What a happiness that was to them ! There were several good things
of this sort. But more often the cause of happiness for

the whole shop, and for Viéra Pavlovna, was a marriage.
There were a good many, and all were fortunate.

The mar-

riage passed off very gayly ; there were evening parties before and after it, a good many surprises to the bride from
her friends in the shop, and a dowry was given her from the

reserve fund ; and, then , again how much work Viéra Pavlovna had ; she had her hands full, of course .

One thing

at first seemed to the shop indelicate on the part of Viéra
Pavlovna : the first bride asked Viéra Pavlovna to be her

nuptial god-mother, but her request was not granted ; the
second did likewise , and was also refused.

More often the

bridal nuptial god-mother was Mrs. Mertsálova or her mother,
who was also a very nice lady ; but Viéra Pavlovna always
refused ; she would help dress the bride, and escort her to
the church, but only in the capacity of one of her friends .
The first time they thought that the refusal was out of displeasure for something or other ; but that was not so ; Viéra

Pavlovna was very glad of the invitation, only she did not


======================================================================

A VITAL QUESTION.

185

accept it ; the second time it was believed that it was from
mere modesty ; Viéra Pavlovna did not want to appear in
public as the patroness of the bride. And, indeed, it was
true that she avoided all appearances of being influential.
She always took pains to bring others to the front, so that a
good many of the ladies, who came to the shop to give order,
could not distinguish her from the other cutters. But Viéra
Pavlovna took the greatest delight when she was explaining
to any one that the whole establishment was founded and
supported by the girls themselves. With these explanations
she tried to convince herself of what she wanted to believe , -

that the shop could get along without her, so that, in time,
other shops might be established of the same kind, entirely
spontaneously ; and why not? wouldn't it be a good thing ?
It would be better than anything else ; even without any
leadership, outside of the rank of seamstresses, but by the
thought and planning of the seamstresses themselves. This
was Viéra Pavlovna's pet dream.
V.

AND thus three years have passed since the union was
founded, and more than three years since Viéra Pavlovna's

marriage. How quietly and busily passed these three years ,
how full they were of calmness, happiness, and all that was
good!

Viéra Pavlovna after waking, long takes her ease in bed ;
she likes to take her ease, and as it were, to doze ; and yet
she does not doze, but she thinks of what must needs be

done ; and so she lies, not dozing and not thinking ; yes ,
she is thinking, " How warm, soft, good, how comfortable
it is to sleep in the morning " ; and so she lies and takes

her ease, until from the neutral room - no , we must say
from one of the neutral rooms ; there are two of them now ,
because it is the fourth year of their wedded life - her hus-

band, that is her milenki, says, " Viérotchka, are you awake ? "
" Yes , milenki .”

That is as good as to say that her husband may begin to
make the tea (in the morning it is his work to make the tea) ,
and that Viéra Pavlovna

no, in her room , she is not Viéra
may dress herself. How long it
takes to dress herself ! No, it does not take her long , - one

in it, and then she takes considerable time with her hair.
No , she does not take very much time for it ; she arranges it
in a minute ; but she trifles with it, because she likes her

hair ; however, sometimes she is long busy with one of the
important stages of her toilet, putting on her shoes ; she
wears elegant shoes ; she dresses very simply, but shoes are
her passion .
And here she comes out to tea, kisses her husband.

"How did you sleep, mílenki?" She talks with him at table
about different trifles and serious things ; however, Viéra
Pavlovna no, Viérotchka, because at morning tea she is
still Viérotchka

drinks not as much tea as cream ; tea is

only pretext for cream, she has more than half a cup of it ;
cream is also her passion. It is hard to find good cream in
Petersburg, but Viérotchka manages to find the best that
there is , without any adulteration. She dreams of having
her own cow ; well, if business improves as it has been doing,
it can be realized in a year's time. But now it is ten o'clock .

"Milenki" goes off to give his lessons or to business ; he is
employed in the office of a manufacturer. Viéra Pavlovna
now she is Viéra Pavlovna again, until the next morning looks after the house ; she has one servant, a young girl
whom she has to teach everything, and after you have taught
her, it is necessary to break in a new one. Viéra Pavlovna
does not keep her servants long ; they all get married !
Within a half-year or a little more, you will see Viéra Pavlovna working on a collar or a pair of cuffs , preparing herself
to be the bride's nuptial godmother ; here it is impossible to
refuse . " How is it possible to do otherwise, Viéra Pavlovna? you have made all the arrangements yourself, there is
no one besides you. " Yes , there is a great deal of care about
the house. Then it is necessary to go and give her lessons ;
she has a good many pupils, about ten hours a week ; more
would be too hard, and she would not have any time. Before
the lessons it is necessary to stop in the shop for a little while ,

and on her way home she has to look in once more. And
then comes dinner with the milenki. At dinner they almost
always have company ; one , more often two.

More than

two is impossible ; when they have two to dinner, it is necessary to do extra work, to prepare a new dish so as to have

enough . If Viéra Pavlovna feels tired when she gets home,
dinner is made more simple. She sits till dinner time in her
own room, resting, and the dinner is put on as it was begun,


======================================================================

A VITAL QUESTION.

187

without her help. But if she is not tired, affairs in the
kitchen begin to boil and steam, and extra dishes appear at
dinner, some baked dish, but more often something that can

be eaten with cream ; that is, something that will serve as an
excuse for cream .

At dinner Viéra Pavlovna asks questions and tells about
things ; more often she tells stories . And how can she help

telling them ? How much news she has to tell about the
shop ! After dinner she sits a quarter of an hour longer with

the milenki . Then comes dō svedánya (good by) , and they
each go to their own room ; and Viéra Pavlovna lies down
on her little bed, and takes her ease and reads, and very often

she falls asleep, more often than not. Every other day she
takes a nap for an hour or an hour and a half; this is a
weakness , and it is a weakness of a low character. But Viéra

Pavlovna sleeps after dinner when she can get a nap ; and
she likes to go to sleep, and she feels neither shame nor regret for this low-toned weakness. She then gets up, after
sleeping or lounging for an hour or two, dresses, and goes
again to the shop, and remains there till tea-time. If they
do not have company in the evening, then at tea she has
another talk with the milenki, and for half an hour they sit
in the neutral room ; then it is, “ Dō svedánya, mílenki " ; they
kiss each other, and part till breakfast.

Now Viéra Pavlovna

sometimes works or reads, or rests from reading by playing
on the piano, till very late, even till two o'clock. She has a
grand piano in her room ; the grand was bought not long
ago ; hitherto their piano was rented. This also was a great
happiness , to own their own grand ; it was cheaper, too.

It was bought at a bargain, for a hundred rubles , - a small
Erarovski, second hand ; it cost seventy rubles to have it
put in order ; but the grand was of an excellent tone. Sometimes the milenki comes to hear her sing ; but only seldom :
he is too busy. Thus goes the evening : work, reading, playing, singing ; but reading and singing most of all. This is
when they do not have company. But very often they have
visitors , generally young people, younger than the “ milenki,”
and younger than Viéra Pavlovna herself ; their number includes the instructors of the shop. They esteem Lopukhóf
very highly ; they consider him one of the best minds in
Petersburg, and perhaps they are not mistaken. And their
tie to the Lopukhófs consists in this : they feel that it is

profitable for them to talk with Dmitri Sergéitch.

Pavlovna they show immense respect ; she even allows them
to kiss her hand, not feeling that it is any degradation to
herself, and she behaves towards them as though she were
fifteen years their senior ; that is , she behaves herself in
such a way when she does not get into a gale ; but, to tell
the truth, she very often gets into a gale. She likes to run,
to frolic with them, and they are all delighted, and there is
a great deal of dancing and waltzing, a great deal of simple
running about, a great deal of playing on the piano, a great

deal of talking and laughter, and probably more singing
than anything else. But the running, laughter, and everything else does not in the least prevent the young people

from absolutely and entirely and boundlessly worshipping
Viéra Pavlovna, from respecting her - as may God grant
respect for an older sister ! - as a mother, not even a good

mother, is not always respected. However, singing is not
frolicking, though sometimes one cannot get along without the nonsense. But for the most part, Viéra Pavlovna
sings seriously ; and sometimes , when she does not sing, she
plays seriously, and her hearers then sit in dumb silence.
Not infrequently they have guests who are older, or who are
of the same age as the Lopukhófs ; for the most part, Lopukhóf's former classmates , or friends of his former comrades ,

two or three young professors, almost all bachelors ; almost
the only married people are the Mertsálofs. The Lopukhófs
do not very often go out, and they go scarcely anywhere else
than to the Mertsálofs', or to Mrs. Mertsálova's parents' ;
these kind and simple-hearted people have a good many sons,
who occupy important places in all possible official departments ; and therefore at the house of the old people, who live
in some comfort, Viéra Pavlovna sees a varied and different
calibered society.

Free , ample , active life, not without its luxuries ; lying at
ease in her soft, warm bed ; cream, or baked dishes and cream ;

it is a life that greatly delights Viéra Pavlovna.
Can there be any better life in the world ? To Viéra Pavlovna it seems impossible .

Well (da) , in early youth nothing better can be imagined .
But years pass on ; and with the years, things improve, if
life goes on as it should, as it goes on with a few now, as it
will pass with a good many in the future.

VI.

ONCE (it was towards the end of summer) the girls gathered, according to their custom on Sunday, at the outskirts
of the city for a picnic. During the summer they used to
go out almost every holiday in boats to the islands. Viéra
Pavlovna generally went with them, and this time Dmitri
Sergéitch went along too, and that made this picnic remarkable. His company was a rarity, and it was the second
time that he had been with them.

The shop, when they

heard about it, was greatly pleased . " Viéra Pavlovna will
be gayer than usual, and it may be expected that the picnic

will be particularly hilarious." Some of them, who had
intended to spend their Sunday otherwise, changed their
plans and joined those who had decided to go. It was necessary to take instead of four great hampers, five, and afterwards the number was increased to six. The company
consisted of fifty people or more. There were more than
twenty seamstresses (there were only six who did not take
part in the picnic) , three middle-aged women, a dozen children or so, - mothers , sisters , and brothers of the seam-

stresses ; three young men -bridegrooms (one was a watchmaker's apprentice, the second was a small dealer, and these
two were not in the least inferior in manners to the third,
who was a school-teacher) ; there were five other young men
of different ranks, among them even two arıny officers ; and
there were eight university and medical students. They
took with them four big samovars, great heaps of different
baked things, huge reserve stores of cold veal and other
eatables. The people are young, there will be much motion,
and the fresh air besides ; one can count on their appetites .

There are half a dozen bottles of wine. For fifty people,
including fifteen young men, it does not seem a great

supply!
And, in point of fact, the picnic turned out better than
was even expected. They had everything. They danced
in sixteen couples , and then in twelve , and also in eighteen ;
and in one quadrille they had even twenty out at once .

They played high spy, about twenty-two couples of them ;
they improvised three swings between the trees ; and in the

intervals they drank tea and partook of luncheon. For half
an hour- no, less, much less - almost half the company

listened to a discussion between Dmitri Sergéitch and two
students , the most radical of all his younger friends. They
found in each other's arguments inconsequentiality, moder-

antism, and bourgeoisism.¹ These were the terms that they
applied to each other ; but in private each one had a special
sin. One student, romanticism, and Dmitri Sergéitch was a
schematist , and the other student believed in rigorism. Of
course a stranger would find it hard to keep up his interest
in such a discussion longer than five minutes ; even one of
the disputants, the romanticist, could not hold out longer
than an hour and a half, then ran off to those who were

dancing ; but he did not run off ingloriously. He was indignant at some moderantist or other (almost with me,
though I was not there at all), and, knowing that the cause
of his indignation was not very old, he cried out, " Why are
you talking about him ? I will tell you the words which
were said to me a few days ago by a respectable person a very witty woman, Only till a man is twenty-five may he
preserve intact the style of his thoughts. " " I know who
that lady is," said an officer who, to the romanticist's mortification , joined the disputants , " It was Mrs. N.

She said it

in my presence, and she is really an elegant woman ; but she
was caught on the spot.

Half an hour before she had said

that she was twenty-six years old, and do you remember
how we all roared ? "

And at this all four laughed, and the romanticist beat a

retreat, laughing. But the officer took his place in the
dispute, and the fun was much more lively than before until
it was tea-time. The officer, while showing up the rigorist
and the schematist much more cruelly than the romanticist

had done, was himself mournfully convicted of Auguste
Comteism. After tea, the officer announced that as long
as his age still allowed his style of thought to be intact, he
would not refrain from joining other people of his age.
Then Dmitri Sergéitch and, though it was much against his
will, the rigorist followed his example. They did not dance
in the dances, but they played high spy. And when the
men decided to run races, to jump over the ditch, then the
three thinkers distinguished themselves as the most agile
champions of manly exercise. The officer received the first
prize for jumping over the ditch. Dmitri Sergéitch, who
was a very strong man, got into a great rage when the

officer defeated him. He hoped to be first in this contest
after the rigorist, who had easily lifted in the air and set

down again both Dmitri Sergéitch and the officer together ;
for this feat aroused no ambition either in the officer or

Dmitri Sergéitch. The rigorist was a recognized athlete,
but Dmitri Sergéitch did not care to endure the affront of
not being able to defeat the officer.

Half a dozen times

they grasped each other, and each time the officer floored
him though not without difficulty. After the sixth wrestling
bout, Dmitri Sergéitch owned himself undoubtedly the
weaker of the two. They were both exhausted. The three
thinkers threw themselves on the grass . They continued
the dispute , and now Dmitri Sergéitch recognized the value

of Auguste Comteism and the officer of schematism, but the
rigorist remained as before , a rigorist.
They went home at eleven o'clock.

The old women and

children fell asleep in the boats (it was a good thing that
they had plenty of warm wraps with them) ; but all the rest
talked without ceasing and in all the six boats there was no
interruption to the jokes and laughter.

VII .

Two days later at morning tea, Viéra Pavlovna remarked
to her husband that she did not like the color of his face .

He said that he had not slept well the night before and that
he had not felt well since evening, but it was of no consequence. He had caught a little cold at the picnic ; of course

during the time when he had been lying on the ground after
their running and wrestling. He gave himself a little
scolding for his carelessness, but he assured Viéra Pavlovna that it was a mere nothing, and he went to his business as usual ; and at supper he said that apparently his ill
turn had entirely passed, but on the following morning he
said that he would have to stay at home for some time.

Viéra Pavlovna, who had been greatly worried since the day
before, became seriously frightened now and insisted on
Dmitri Sergéitch calling a doctor.
" But I myself am a doctor, and can heal myself, if it is

necessary ; but, as yet, there is no need of doing anything,”
said Dmitri Sergéitch, trying to smooth it off. But Viéra
Pavlovna was inflexible , and so he wrote a note to Kirsánof,

adding that his illness was trifling, and that he asked him to
call, simply to please his wife.
Therefore , Kirsánof did not make haste ; he stayed at the
hospital till dinner time, and called at the Lopukhófs at six
o'clock in the evening .

" Well, Aleksandr, I did well to call you," said Lopukhóf ;
" there is no danger, and I don't think that there is going to
be any ; but I have inflammation of the lungs .

Of course I

could have cured myself without your aid, but for all that,
please take my case in hand. It cannot be helped ; it is
necessary to satisfy my conscience ; you see, I am not a
bachelor , as you are."

They made a long examination of the lung ; Kirsánof
sounded his chest, and they both agreed that Lopukhóf was

not mistaken ; there was no danger, and, in all probability ,
there would be none . But the inflammation of the lung was
severe . It would be necessary for him to stay in the house

for ten days, Lopukhóf for some time having neglected his
illness, but yet it could be cured.
Kirsánof had to have a long talk with Viéra Pavlovna, to
quiet her alarm. Finally she was convinced that they were
not deceiving her ; that, in all probability, the illness was
not only not serious, but not even difficult ; but this was only
" in all probability " ; but are there not contingencies which
arise contrary to all probability ?
Kirsánof began to call twice a day on the sick man ; they
both saw that the illness was without complications , and not

dangerous .

On the fourth morning, Kirsánof said to Viéra

Pavlovna : -

" Dmitri is all right ; everything is going well with him ;
for three or four days more it may be hard, but it will not be
more severe than it is to-day, and then he will begin to gain.
But I want to talk seriously about you yourself, Viéra Pavlovna. You do not act wisely, in sitting up all night ; he
does not need a nurse ; he does not even need me . But you

nay harm yourself, all for nothing. Your nerves are already
very much unstrung ."
For a long time he tried to reason with Viéra Pavlovna,
but without avail.

" I know it's nothing ," and, " There's no

reason in it, " and " I should be glad to, but I cannot,"
that is , glad to sleep in the night-time, and leave her hus-

band without a watcher. Finally she said : " All that you
are telling me now, he has already told me many times, as


======================================================================

A VITAL QUESTION.

you know well.

193

Of course, I would have listened to him

sooner than to you ; consequently, I can't."
Against such an argument there is no disputing. Kirsánof
shook his head and went away.

He came to see the sick man at ten o'clock, that evening,
and sat by his bedside, together with Viéra Pavlovna, for
half an hour, and then he said : " Now, Viéra Pavlovna , go

and get some rest.

We both ask you to. I am going to

stay here to-night. "

Viéra Pavlovna hesitated ; she herself knew, or more than
half knew, that it was not necessary to sit all night beside
the sick man, and here she is compelling Kirsánof, who is a

busy man, to waste his time. And what was it in reality ?
" It apparently is not necessary " ; apparently, but who
knows ? No ; it is impossible to leave the milenki alone !
Who knows what might happen ? He may want a drink, he
may want tea ; he is so delicate, he will not wake up ; consequently, it is impossible not to sit by his side. But it is not
necessary for Kirsánof ; she will not allow it.

She said that

she would not go away, for she was not very tired ; that she
was taking a great deal of rest in the daytime :
" Under the present circumstances , I beg of you to leave

us entirely to ourselves." Kirsánof took her hand and led
her from the room, almost by main force .

" I am really ashamed of her, Aleksandr," said the sick
man ; " what a ridiculous part you are playing, to sit up all
night with a man who is not sick enough to need it. But I
am very grateful to you. I could not even persuade her to
hire a nurse, when she was afraid to leave me alone ; she

would not trust me in anybody's hands . "
" If I had not seen that it was impossible for her to be
calm when you were in somebody else's care, then, of
course, I should not have disturbed my comfort. But now,
I hope that she will get some sleep. I am a doctor, and I
am your friend. "
In fact, Viéra Pavlovna , as soon as she touched her bed ,

fell sound asleep. Three sleepless nights in themselves
would not have been so trying, and the worriment by itself would not have been so trying, but the worriment,
together with the sleepless nights , without any rest in the
daytime, was very dangerous ; two or three days and nights
more without sleep. and she would have been more seriously
ill than her husband.


======================================================================

194

A VITAL QUESTION.

Kirsánof spent three nights more with the sick man, for
it did not tire him much, because he slept very peacefully ;
only out of carefulness he locked the door, so that Viéra
Pavlovna should not see his unconcern. She suspected that
he slept instead of watching ; she was calm , however, be-

cause he was a doctor, and there were no grounds for fear,
were there ? He himself knows whether he ought to sleep or
not.

She was ashamed that she could not have been calm

before, so as not to have disturbed him ; but now he paid no
attention to her assurances , that she would sleep even though
he were not there .

" You are to blame, Viéra Pavlovna, and, therefore , you
must be punished ; I do not trust you ! "
But, in four days, it was perfectly obvious to her that the
sick man was no longer sick ; the proofs even to her skepticism were very clear ; that very evening they were playing
cards ; Lopukhóf was half lying down, or was not even
lying down at all, and he spoke in a very clear voice. Kirsánof could stop his somnolent watching, and announced
that fact .

" Aleksandr Matvéitch, why have you entirely forgotten
me, - I mean me ? You are always on good terms with
Dmitri ; he calls on you very often ; but you have not called
on us till this sickness -it seems to me for a half a year,

it's such a long time ! and, don't you remember, we used to
be very good friends ? "
" People change, Viéra Pavlovna. Then, again, I am
working very hard, if I may say a word for myself. I call
on scarcely anybody ; I have no time ; besides, I am lazy.

You get so tired, being at the hospital and the medical
school from nine o'clock till five, that you don't feel it possible to go anywhere else, or make any change , except from
your uniform into your smoking-jacket. Friendship is a
good thing ; but don't get angry, if I say that a cigar on
a sofa, in a smoking-jacket, is better still ! "

And, in fact, Kirsánof had not called on the Lopukhófs for
more than two years . The reader has not once noticed his
name among the common guests, and among the frequent

callers for a long time ; he was the most infrequent of all.


======================================================================

A VITAL QUESTION.

195

VIII .

THE sapient reader - I explain myself only to the mas-

culine reader; my lady reader has too much understanding
to be bothered with guessing, and therefore I do not explain
to her ; I say this once and for all. There are also among my
masculine readers not a few who are not stupid, and to this
class of readers also, I do not need to make any explanation ;

but the majority of readers - and this number includes
almost all literary men, and those who claim to be literary
men - are sapient, and it is always agreeable for me to
talk with such ; and so the sapient reader says : " I understand how the affair is going to turn. A new romance is

going to begin in Viéra Pavlovna's life, and in this Kirsánof is going to play a part. I understand even more ;
Kirsánof fell in love with Viéra Pavlovna long ago, and

that was the reason why he ceased to call on the Lopukhófs. Oh, what penetration you have, my sapient readers !
As soon as you are told anything, then you say, " I thought

so, " and you plume yourself on your shrewdness. I bow
before you , sapient reader !

And thus in Viéra Pavlovna's life appears a new person,
and it would be necessary to describe him, if he had not
already been described. When I spoke about Lopukhóf, I

had some difficulty in distinguishing between him and his
intimate friend, and there was scarcely anything more that
I could have said about him that I should not have to re-

peat about Kirsánof. And, in fact, everything that the
(sapient) reader can learn from the following description of
Kirsánof's characteristics , will be a repetition of Lopukhóf's
characteristics .
Lopukhóf was the son of a meshchanin,
who was well to do for a man of his rank,
that is , one

who very often has meat in his shchi; Kirsánof was the son
of a clerk in a provincial court,- that is, a man who often
has no meat in his shchi ; or, in other words , not very often

has meat in his shchi. Lopukhóf, in very early youth ,
almost from childhood , earned money for his own support ;
Kirsánof , after he reached the age of twelve, helped his

father copy papers, and he gave lessons while he was still in
the fourth class in the gymnasium. They both, by their
own exertion, without connections, without acquaintances,
made their own way. What sort of a man was Lopukhóf ?


======================================================================

196

A VITAL QUESTION.

In the gymnasium he did not succeed in learning French,
and he did not go further in German than the declension of
der , die , das , with few mistakes ; but after he entered the

medical school, Lopukhóf soon saw that he could not make
great progress in science with the Russian language alone ;
he took a French dictionary and such French books as happened to be at hand, and those that fell into his hands were :
" Télémaque " and the stories of Madame Geulis , and sev-

eral livraisons of our clever journal Revue Etrangère. They
were not very attractive books, but he took them; and
though he was an eager reader, he said, " I shall not open a
Russian book until I am able to read French fluently." And

thus he learned French fluently. But he acted differently in
regard to German : he rented a room in a house where

there were a good many German laborers ; it was a wretched
hole ; the Germans were tiresome ; it was a long walk to the

medical school, but he lived there until he had accomplished
what he needed .

Kirsánof did in a different way : he learned the German
through different books , with a lexicon, just as Lopukhóf

learned French, but French he acquired in a peculiar fashion
through one book without a lexicon .

It was the Gospels ,

a very familiar book ; and he took the New Testament,
in the translation of Geneva ; then he read it over eight

times ; the ninth time he understood it thoroughly ; and so
he mastered it. What kind of a man was Lopukhóf? This
was what he was . One time he was walking in a shabby
uniform on the Kammenoi-Ostrof Prospekt, on his way from
his lesson, for which he got fifty kopeks (thirty cents) an
hour, though he had to go a distance of three versts from
the lyceum. A distinguished somebody, of imposing mien,
met him , motions him out of the way in the manner of men of

imposing mien, and bears straight down upon him without
giving way. But Lopukhóf, at that time, had a rule, not to
be the first to turn out for anybody except a woman.

They

bumped against each other with their shoulders, and the
distinguished somebody, half turning about, said, " What a

pig, what a hog you are ! " but while he was preparing to
continue the lesson, Lopukhóf made a full turn towards
the distinguished somebody, took the distinguished somebody by the body, and deposited him in the gutter very
tenderly ; then he stood over him, and said, " Don't you
move, else I will drag you farther where the mud is deeper. "


======================================================================

A VITAL QUESTION.

197

Two muzhiks passed, looked on, praised him ; a tchinovnik
passed, looked at him, and did not praise him, but smiled
sweetly ; some carriages passed by ; no one looked out ; it
could not be seen who was lying in the gutter ; Lopukhóf
stood there for a time, then he took the distinguished somebody, not by the body this time, but by the hand, picked
him up, led him upon the highway, and said, " Akh, my
dear sir, how did you happen to get into this plight ? You
have not done yourself any harm, I hope ? Allow me to
brush your coat ! "

A muzhik passed by, and began to help wipe the dirt off
from the distinguished somebody. Two meshchánins passed ;
they also stopped to help wipe him off ; they wiped the dirt
off from the distinguished somebody, and departed.
Kirsánof never had such an experience as that ; but this
was what happened to him : A certain lady, who had people
to run errands for her, thought that it was necessary to have
prepared a catalogue of the library left her by her husband,
who was a follower of Voltaire, and had died twenty years
before. Why such a catalogue was needed, after the lapse
of twenty years, is more than I can tell. Kirsánof was selected to arrange the catalogue, at a salary of eighty rubles .
He worked at it a month and ahalf. Suddenly the lady came
to the conclusion that the catalogue was not necessary. She
came into the library and said : " Don't take any more trouble
about this work ; I have changed my mind. And here's to

pay you " ; and she gave Kirsánof ten rubles. " Your ladyship " (he gave the lady the benefit of her full title) , " I have
already done more than half the work ; out of seventeen
shelves I have already catalogued ten. "
" Do you find that I have taken advantage of you as regards pay ? - Nicolas, come here and talk this matter over
with this gentleman. "
Nicholas came in .

" How do you dare to insult my maman ? ”
" You are a milk-sucker ! "

An unjustifiable expression on Kirsánof's part. Nicolas
was five years older than he .
" You had better hear both sides first ."

" Help ! "

cried Nicolas .

" Help ? I will show you how to call for help. "
In the twinkling of an eye the lady screamed and fell in
a swoon ; and Nicolas felt that he could not move his

hands, which were fixed to his sides, as by an iron belt ;
and indeed they were pinned by Kirsánof's right hand, while
his left hand had Nicolas by the jaw, ready to clutch his
throat, and Kirsánof was saying, " Just see how easily I
can choke you." And he squeezed his gullet ; and Nicolas
perceived that it was a very easy thing for Kirsanof to choke
him ; but Kirsánof's hand has already left his throat. He
can breathe freely; and yet Kirsánof's hand is at his throat.
And Kirsánof addressing the Goliaths who appeared at the
door, says : " Stay where you are, else I shall choke him !
Get out of here, else I shall choke him ! "

All this Nicolas

understood in the twinkling of an eye ; he made a sign with
his nose , which signified that Kirsánof was right in the case .

" Now, brother, see me down stairs," said Kirsánof, again
turning to Nicolas, and continuing to embrace Nicolas as
before.
He went into the front room, went down stairs ,
followed from afar by the astonished gaze of the Goliaths ,

and on the last step he let go of Nicolas' throat, pushed
Nicolas himself away, and went into a store to buy a cap,
in place of the one which had remained as a prey in the
possession of Nicolas .

Now, what difference can you find between such people ?
All their most prominent features are features not of indi-

viduals , but of a type ; a type differing so greatly from
that to which you are accustomed, sapient reader, that its

general peculiarities hide the individual differences in them.
These people when seen amongst others , are like Europeans

among Chinamen, whom the Chinamen cannot distinguish
apart.

In all of them they see one characteristic , that they

are " red-headed barbarians, who do not understand any
ceremonies." In their eyes the French are just as redheaded as the English. And the Chinamen are right, as
they look upon it ; all Europeans are like any one European,
not individuals , but representatives of a type, and nothing
more .

All of them alike do not eat

cockroaches

and

centipedes ; they are alike in not cutting people into little

bits ; they all alike drink brandy and wine made from grapes,
and not from rice. And actually, even the one thing which
the Chinamen see, is their native custom, the drinking of

tea, practised in a diametrically different way from their
with sugar, and never without sugar.
Thus people of the type to which Lopukhóf and Kirsánof
belong seem alike to people of a different type. Every one
way,

of them is a man, dauntless , firm, unwavering, capable of

undertaking any matter ; and if he undertakes it, he sticks
so resolutely to it that it cannot slip out of his grasp. This
is one side of their nature .

Another side : each one of them

is a man of irreproachable integrity, so much so that the
question never even enters our mind, " Is it possible to rely

on this person unconditionally ? " It is as clear as the fact
that he breathes with his lungs ; as long as the lungs breathe,
such a heart is warm and unchanged. You can lean your
head upon such a bosom, you can rest upon it. These general features are so prominent that the personal peculiarities
are covered over by them.

It is not long that this type has been in existence among
us. In former times there were only isolated individuals,
who gave promise of it ; they were exceptions , and as ex-

ceptions they felt lonely and powerless, and for that very
reason they were inactive , or they fell into despair, or they
felt exalted, or became romantic or fanciful ; that is , they

could not possess the chief characteristic of this type ;
they could not show any cool practicability, an even, wellregulated activity, or active, sound good sense. Those were
people who, though they had this very same nature, had not
yet developed into this type ; and this type is a recent
growth ; in my time it had not yet come into existence, though

I am not very old ; in fact, am not at all an old man. I myself could not have come to be such. I was brought up in a
different epoch ; and for the very reason because I myself
am not of this type, I can, without the least hesitation, ex-

press my respect for it ; unfortunately I do not give myself
a word of praise when I say in regard to these people, They
are good people.

This type sprang up not long ago, and it is growing
rapidly. It was engendered by the times, it is a sign of the
times , and, shall I say further, it will vanish with its time,
and not a long time either. Its already short life is doomed
to be short in the future. Six years ago these people were
not to be seen ; three years ago they were despised ; and
now ! - but it does not make any difference what is thought

about them now ; in a very few years , a very few years, these
people will be called upon, " Save us ! " and whatever they

will say, will be believed by everybody ; a few years more,
and maybe not years but months, and they will be cursed,
and they will be driven off the stage, they will be hissed and


======================================================================

200

insulted.

A VITAL QUESTION.

All right, hiss and cast insults, drive them away

and curse ; you have gained your benefit from them ; that is

sufficient for them, and amid the noise of hissings, amid the
thunder of curses, they will leave the scene, proud and
modest, stern and kind, as they have ever been. And will
nothing be left of them on the stage ? No. How will the

world get along without them ? Wretchedly. But after
them it will be still better than if they had not been. And
years will pass , and people will say, " After they left, the
world was better, but still it is bad enough." And when
this is said, it shows that the time for this type has come
again, and it will come again and be represented in greater
numbers , in better forms , because then there will be more of

good in the world ; and again the same history will be
repeated in a new light. And so it will come to pass that
men shall say, " Well, now we are enjoying life " ; and
then it will not be an exceptional type, because all people
will be of this same type, and they will find it difficult to
understand how there ever was a time when it was considered

a peculiar type, and not the general nature of all people.
IX .

But as Europeans among Chinamen are all of one face
and one way of acting, only so far as the Chinamen are con-

cerned , but in reality, among the Europeans there are
incomparably wider differences than among the Chinese ; so
in this apparently monotonous type, the variety of individualities is developed into more classes and are more distinguishable from each other than among all the varieties of all
the different types that are separate from each other. Here

you find all sorts of people,- sybarites, ascetic, severe, and
tender-hearted, and every other kind. But, as the sternest of
Europeans is very kind, the most cowardly is very brave,
the most passionate is very moral in comparison with the
Chinaman, so it is with these ; the most ascetic of them
deems it more necessary for all men to be more comfortable

than is imagined by the people not of this type ; the most
passionate are more stern in their moral rules than the greatest moralizers not of this type. But all this they interpret

according to their own fashion ; and morality, comfort, and
sensuality and goodness, they understand in a peculiar way ;

and they all understand them in the same way, and not only

dothey all understand them in one way, but this one way is
such a way that morality, comfort, goodness, and passion are
all regarded as one and the same thing . But all this , again,

is only when it comes into comparison with the understanding of the Chinamen ; among themselves a great deal of
difference is found in understanding these things , according
to the differences of their nature.

But how now to bring

into harmony this conflict of nature and understanding among
themselves ?

In conversations about their own affairs among themselves,
and only among themselves, and not among Chinamen,
European natures give expression to their characteristics .
Thus, among the people of this type, apparently there is a
very great variety of natures when they are among themselves, and only among themselves and not with strangers .
We have had before us two people of this type, Viéra
Pavlovna and Lopukhóf, and we have seen how their relations were arranged between them. Now there comes in a
third person.

Let us see what difference will be shown now

that we have the possibility of comparing the other two with
this one.
Kirsánof.

But it is necessary to say two or three words about Kirsánof's outward appearance.

He, as well as Lopukhóf, had regular and handsome features. Some regarded the former, others the latter, as the
better looking. Lopukhóf was rather thinner, had dark chestnut hair, gleaming dark eyes, which seemed almost black , an
aquiline nose , thick lips, and a rather oval face. Kirsánof
had blonde hair, inclining to a brownish shade, dark blue
eyes , a straight Grecian nose, a small mouth, an oblong face,
and a remarkably light complexion. Both were men of very
tall stature, and straight ; Lopukhóf somewhat broader across
his shoulders , Kirsánof somewhat taller.

Kirsanóf's outward circumstances were very good. He
was now a professor. The largest majority at the balloting
was at first opposed to him ; not only did they want to refuse
him his professorship, but they would have taken away his
doctor's degree ; but this was impossible. Two or three
young men, and one, not a young man, from among his for

mer professors, friends of his, long ago declared to the rest
of the faculty that there was in the world a certain Virchow,
and he lived in Berlin , and also a certain Claude Bernard ,

and he lived in Paris, and certain others, whose names you
could not remember, who also lived in various towns ; and
that Virchow, Claude Bernard, and the others were the stars ,
as it were , of the medical science. All this seemed extremely

improbable, because we know all the stars of science,- Burghaf, Hufeland ; and Harvey was also a very distinguished
man, who discovered the circulation of the blood ; then Jenner,
who taught vaccination. And so we know them ; but these
Virchows and Claude Bernards we do not know ; what kind
of stars are they ? However, the devil knows them. And

here this very Claude Bernard spoke with respect about Kirsánof's works , when Kirsánof took his degree. And so they
could not help it; they had to give Kirsánof the degree of
doctor ; and a year and a half later they gave him a professorship. The students said that if he came into the faculty,
the party of good professors would be increased. He had
never practised, and he said that he had given up the prac-

tice of medicine. But he used to spend long hours at the
hospital ; it happened that he dined there on some days , and
even slept there many nights. But what has he done there ?
He said that he was working for science, and not for the sake
of the sick. " I do not cure ; I only observe , and make ex-

periments . " The students confirmed this , and declared that
at the present time only quacks cured, because at this time
it is impossible to effect cures. The hospital servants judged
the matter in a different way. " Well, this Kirsánof takes
folks home into his palace ; it must be a bad case ," they used

to say among themselves ; and then they would say to the
patient, " Keep up good heart ; it takes a tough sickness to
stand up against this surgeon ; he is a master, and a real
father."

XI .

DURING the first part of Viéra Pavlovna's married life, Kirsánof used to be very frequently at the Lopukhófs', as often
as every other day, or, to speak more accurately, almost

every day ; and soon, almost on the very first day, he became
very close friends with Viéra Pavlovna, nearly as much so as

with Lopukhóf. It lasted this way for half a year. One

A VITAL QUESTION.

time they were sitting all three together : he, the husband,
and the wife. The conversation was going on as usual, without any ceremony. Kirsánof was doing the most of the talking, but suddenly he grew silent.
"What has got into you, Aleksandr ? "
" What has made you so solemn all of a sudden, Aleksandr
Matvéitch ? "

" Nothing in particular ; I feel rather blue."
" That does not happen to you very often," said Viéra
Pavlovna .

" I might say, never, without some reason," said Kirsánof,
in a constrained tone .

A few minutes afterwards he got up and went away, earlier than some times, taking his leave in his usual simple
manner .

Two days afterwards Lopukhóf told Viéra Pavlovna that
he had been to see Kirsánof, who , as it seemed to him, had

received him in a very strange way. Kirsánof apparently
wanted to be ceremonious towards him, and this had always
been an unnecessary formality between them. Lopukhóf
had looked him straight in the face, and said :
"Aleksandr, you must be provoked with some one ; is it
with me ? "
" No."

" Is it with Viérotchka ? "
" No."

" Then what is the matter with you ?"
" Nothing at all ; it is only in your imagination. "
" Why aren't you friendly towards me to-day ? You are
not natural ; you are as though you were provoked."
Kirsánof began to pour out his assurances that Lopukhóf
was mistaken; and in this way he managed to confirm the
impression that he was provoked. Then , afterwards , it
seemed as though he must have been ashamed ; he again became as unaffected , kind , friendly, as could be desired.

Lo-

pukhóf, availing himself of the fact that the man seemed in
his right mind again, asked him : " Now, Aleksandr, tell me the reason of your getting provoked ."

" I never thought of being provoked."

And again he be-

came disagreeable and disputatious .

What a marvel ! Lopukhóf could not think of anything
that might have offended him ; and this did not seem possi

ble, considering all their mutual respect and warmth of friendship. Viéra Pavlovna also tried hard to recollect whether
she could have offended him in any manner, and she , too,
could think of nothing out of the way ; for she knew, just as
her husband did, that it was impossible, as far as she was
concerned .

Two days more passed; for Kirsánof not to call at the
Lopukhófs' for four days was a most unusual circumstance.
Viéra Pavlovna even wondered " could he be well? "

Lo-

pukhóf went round to see if he were really ill. " How ? ill ? "
He is still angry. Lopukhóf questioned him persistently.
After repeated negations, he began to get off some disjointed
nonsense about his relations with Lopukhóf and Viéra Pavlovna; that he loves and respects them very highly ; but
after all that had happened, they were not attentive enough
to him.

But in what respect - and this was worst of all

there was not the slightest hint in his bombastic talk. It
was clear that the gentleman was eaten up by ambition. All
this was so savage to witness in such a man as Lopukhóf
considered Kirsánof to be, and so the visitor said to his
host:

" Now, listen ; we have been friends ; and the time will

come when you will be ashamed of this ."
Kirsánof, with affected humility, replied that, in fact, it
must on his side be a mere trifle ; but what can be done,

supposing he has been offended by many things ?
" Nu , what was it then ?"

He began to bring up a good many occasions at which he
had taken offence lately, all in such a style as this: “ You
said that the lighter the hair of a person , the nearer he is to

dulness ; Viéra Pavlovna said that tea was getting dearer .
The one was a hit at the color of my hair ; the other was a
hint that I was eating you out of house and home. "
Lopukhóf's hands fell to his side. This man has gone
crazy with his ambition ; or, properly speaking, he has become a fool and a good-for-nothing !

Lopukhóf returned home in a gloomy frame of mind ; it
was bitter for him to see such a warp in a man of whom he
was so fond.

To Viéra Pavlovna's questions as to what he

had learned, he answered gloomily that it would be better not
to speak about it ; that Kirsánof had spoken disagreeable
nonsense, and that he was probably sick.

In three or four days Kirsánof, who had in all probability

come to his senses and seen the savage disgracefulness of his
behavior, came to the Lopukhófs . He behaved himself as
well as possible ; then he began to tell how mean he had been .
From Viéra Pavlovna's words he perceived she had not heard

from her husband of his absurdities . He sincerely thanked
Lopukhóf for his consideration ; and, as a punishment to
himself, he began to tell the whole story to Viéra Pavlovna.

He grew sentimental ; he excused himself, and said that he
was sick, and again there followed some more nonsense.
Viéra Pavlovna tried to say that he ought to stop talking
about it ; that it was a mere trifle. He clung to the word
trifle, and began to rattle off the same sort of ridiculous nonsense as he had done before, in his talk with Lopukhóf. He

very delicately and circumstantially began to develop the
thought that of course it was a trifle, because he was aware
of his insignificance in the eyes of the Lopukhófs, but that
he didn't deserve any more ; and so on. And all this was
said with the most underhanded, slyest hints, and, at the
same time , with the most courteous expressions of respect

and devotion. Viéra Pavlovna, hearing this, let her hands
fall to her side exactly as her husband had done. When he
had gone, they remembered that for several days previous to
his entirely losing his balance he had been strange. Before,
they had not noticed it particularly, or even perceived it ; but
now his former absurdities are explained. They were of the
same kind , only more developed .

After this, Kirsánof began to call very often ; but the continuation of their former simple relations was utterly impossible .

From behind the mask of a respectable man there

appeared such a long ass-ear that the Lopukhófs would have
lost a great part of their respect for their former friend, even
if this ear were hidden henceforth forever ; but it contin-

ued to appear frequently. It would not show itself for any

long time, and then it would hide itself ; but it was pitiful,
low, and ugly.
They soon became entirely cold to Kirsánof; and as he

really had no pleasure in calling at the Lopukhófs' , he soon
ceased to call .

But he still used to meet the Lopukhófs at the houses of
friends .

Some time afterwards the spite of the Lopukhófs

towards him grew less ; there was nothing serious the matter
now. Lopukhóf began to call on him. In a year he even
began to call at the Lopukhófs' again, and he was the same

A VITAL QUESTION.

elegant Kirsánof as of old, simple and honest.

But he called

seldom ; it was evident that he hesitated and was ashamed,

when he remembered the stupid business of which he had
been guilty. Lopukhóf had almost forgotten about it, and
so had Viéra Pavlovna. But the cordial relations , once sev-

ered, had never returned again. According to outward appearances , he and Lopukhóf were close friends, and, in fact,
they were so. Lopukhóf began almost to respect him as
before, and called on him not unfrequently. Viéra Pavlovna
also gave him back a portion of her former friendliness ; but
she saw him very seldom.
XII .

Now Lopukhóf's illness, or, more properly speaking, Viéra
Pavlovna's extraordinary attachment to her husband, compelled Kirsánof to be more than a week in close, familiar
intercourse with the Lopukhófs .

He knew that he was step-

ping in a dangerous path, when he decided to spend whole
nights with them, in order to take away Viéra Pavlovna's
watch. How happy and proud he had been when, three
years ago, having noticed in himself some signs of passion ,
he had so strenuously succeeded in doing all that was necessary for the interruption of its development. How delighted
he felt at this !

Two or three weeks he was drawn to the

Lopukhófs ; but at that time he felt more satisfaction from

recognizing his firmness in the struggle than pain from the
deprivation, and in a month the pain entirely passed, and there
remained only the pleasure of his uprightness. It was so
calm and delightful in his soul.
But now there was more danger than then.

In these three

years Viéra Pavlovna had assuredly undergone great moral
development. Then she was scarcely more than a child ; now
it is otherwise. The emotion stirred by her could no longer

resemble the amusing attachment to a little girl whom you
love, and at whom you smile at the same time. And not
only morally had she developed. If the beauty of a woman
is a real beauty, then, in our far North, a beautiful woman
grows more beautiful every year. Yes , three years of life at
such a period develop a great deal of good in the soul, in the
eyes, in the features, and in the whole person, if the person
is good and the person's life is good.

It was a great danger, but only for him, Kirsánof. What


======================================================================

A VITAL QUESTION.

207

danger could there be for Viéra Pavlovna ? She loves her
husband. kirsánof is not so stupid and conceited as to look
upon himself as a dangerous rival for Lopukhóf. And not

out of false modesty does he think this ; all respectable people
who know him and Lopukhóf put them on the same level.
And on Lopukhóf's side is the immeasurable advantage of
having already won her love ; yes , won it ; he has absolutely
gained her heart. Her choice is already made, and she is
satisfied with her choice ; and she can have no thought of
looking for something better. Isn't it good enough as it is ?
It is ridiculous to think about it ; this fear on her account

and Lopukhóf's would be a very stupid piece of self-conceit
on Kirsánof's part .

And is it out of any such stupid nonsense that Kirsánof
should have to suffer a month, perhaps two ? Is it from any
such nonsense that he should let a woman strain her nerves ,

and run the risk of serious illness by sitting by her husband's
bedside ? Is it worth while, for the sake of avoiding a trifling
and short interference with his old quiet and well-regulated
life , to let serious harm befall a man , a man of no less worth ?
And this would have been dishonorable.

And this dishonor-

able action is more disagreeable than the really not very
severe struggle with himself which he would have to undergo,

and the final end of which in the proud satisfaction of his own
firmness there could be no doubt.

Thus reasoned Kirsánof, when deciding to relieve Viéra
Pavlovna from her idle watching .
The necessity for the watching passed. For the preservation of propriety, so as not to make an abrupt stop, which
would attract attention, Kirsánof had to call two or three

times more on the Lopukhófs every day, then in a week, then
in a month, then in a half-year ; and then his absence would
be sufficiently explained by his occupation.
XIII .

EVERYTHING was going well with Kirsánof, as he thought.
His attachment was renewed, and stronger than before ; but
the struggle with it did not present any serious suffering ; it

was easy.

Here Kirsánof was at the Lopukhófs' for the sec-

ond time since Dmitri Sergéitch's cure was effected ; and he
was going to stay till nine o'clock ; that would be enough ;

formality would be observed.

Next he would call in two

weeks' time ; then the separation would be almost accomplished. And now it would be necessary to sit one hour
more . Andduring this week the development of his passion

had been about half scotched ; in a month everything would
be over.

He is very well satisfied ; he takes part in the con-

versation as naturally as possible, because he is rejoiced at
his success, and his very satisfaction gives him greater unconcern .

Lopukhóf expected to go out of doors for the first time on
the morrow.

On this account Viéra Pavlovna was in a re-

markably lively state of mind ; she was even more rejoiced
than the invalid himself. The conversation turned upon the
illness. They laughed about it ; and they praised, in a jocular tone , Viéra Pavlovna's wifely self-sacrifice, who had nearly
upset her own health by worrying over what was not worth
worrying about.
" Laugh away, laugh away," she said ; " but I know well
that if you had been in my place, you would not have had
enough strength of mind to act any way different. "

" What an influence the solicitude of others has upon a
person," said Lopukhóf ; " now, the sick man himself is subjected to the delusion that he must take God-knows- what care
of himself, when he sees that people are worried on his ac-

count. I might have left the house three days ago , but I still
stayed in the house ; and this very morning I wanted to go
out, but I postponed it for one day more, so that there might
be less danger. "

" Yes, you might have gone out a long time ago," said
Kirsánof in confirmation .

" Now, I call this heroism, and, to tell the truth , I am

awfully tired of it ; I should like to go out this instant."
" My dear, it was for the sake of putting me at ease that

you showed your heroism. But let us go out this very
moment, if you are so anxious to put an end to your quarantine. I am going to run over to the shop for half an hour ;
let's all go together. It will be very good of you, after your
sickness , to pay your first visit to our union. The girls will
notice it, and will be greatly pleased at such an attention."

" All right ; let's go all together," said Lopukhóf, with
noticeable satisfaction at the idea of breathing fresh air
to-day.
" I declare ! the hostess has shown fine tact ! " said Viéra

Pavlovna. It did not occur to me that perhaps Aleksandr
Matvéitch might not care to go with us.”
" No, on the contrary, it is very interesting to me ; I have

been wanting, for a long time, to go there. Your thought is
ahappy one."

In point of fact, Viéra Pavlovna's suggestion turned out
propitiously. The girls were really delighted that Lopukhóf
paid them the first visit after his sickness. Kirsánof was
greatly interested in the shop ; and a man of his turn of
thought could not help being interested. If a special cause
had not prevented him, he would have been from the very
first one of the most enthusiastic instructors in it.

Half an

hour, or maybe even an hour, in the shop passed before they
knew it. Viéra Pavlovna led him through the different
rooms , and showed him everything. While they were returning from the dining-hall into the working-rooms, a girl,
who had not been in the working-rooms, came up to Viéra
Pavlovna. The girl and Kirsánof looked at each other.
" Nástenka ! "

" Sasha ! " ¹ and they embraced each other.
" Sáshenka, my dear, how glad I am to see you ! " The
girl kept on kissing him, and laughed and cried at once.
Coming to her senses from joy, she said : " No, Viéra Pavlovna, I am not going to speak about business now ; I cannot

part from him .

Come, Sáshenka, let us go to my room . "

Kirsánof was no less glad than she.

But Viéra Pavlovna

noticed an expression of deep grief in his eyes, after he recognized her. And this was not to be wondered at ; the girl
was in the last stages of consumption .

Nástenka had entered the union about a year before, and
even then was very ill. If she had remained in the shop
where she had been working till that time, she would have
died.

But in the union there was a chance for her to live

somewhat longer. The girls entirely relieved her from sewing. It was easy for them to give her other work that was
not harmful for her to do .

She looked after the little inter-

ests of the shop ; she took charge of the closets ; she received

orders ; and no one could say that Nástenka was less useful
that any one else in the shop.

The Lopukhófs went away, without waiting for Kirsánof
to finish his interview with Nástenka.

Nastasia Borisovna Kriukova.

NÁSTENKA'S STORY.

On the next day, early in the morning, Nástenka came to
Viéra Pavlovna .

" I want to tell you about what you saw yesterday, Viéra
Pavlovna ," she said ; but for some time she was at a loss
how to go on. " I would not want you to think ill of him ,
Viera Pavlovna."

" What do you mean ? You must have a poor opinion of
me , Nastasia Borisovna."
" No ; if it were some one else besides me, I should not
have thought of such a thing ; but you know I am not like
other girls . "

" No , Nastasia Borisovna, you have no right to speak about
yourself in such a way. We have known you for a year ;
and before that a good many of our Union knew you."
" This proves that you do not know anything about me."
" How so ? I know a good deal about you. You have
been a servant-girl, the last time you were with the actress
N.; after she got married, you left her, so as to avoid her
father-in-law ; you entered Y.'s shop, and from there you
came to us . I know all the particulars about it."
" Of course, I know that Maksimova and Shéïna, who knew

all about me, would not tell anything to anybody. But, after
all, I thought that you and the others might have heard about
me .
Akh ! how glad I am they yonder don't know anything
about it ! And I am going to tell you, so that you may know
what a good man he is. I have been a very bad girl, Viéra
Pavlovna .”

" You , Nastasia Borisovna ? "
" Yes , Viéra Pavlovna, I have .

I have been a very bold

girl ; I had not the slightest shame, and I used to be always
drunk .

And that's the reason that I am ill, Viéra Pavlovna,

because with my weak lungs I used to drink too much."
This was the third case of the kind that had come under

Viéra Pavlovna's observation.

These girls , who had behaved

themselves with perfect propriety since their acquaintance
with her. told her that hitherto they had been leading bad
lives .

The first time she was amazed at such a confession ;

but, after reasoning it over for several days, she asked her

self : " How about my own life? The filth in which I grew
up was also very bad. However, it did not stick to me ; and
there are probably thousands of women who have grown up
in purity in families worse than mine. Is there anything
strange in the fact that those whom a happy chance has

brought out from such degradation are not ruined?"
She listened to the second confession, and was not sur-

prised, because the girl who made it had kept intact all the
noble peculiarities of a human being, -generosity, capability
for genuine service, and softness of heart, had even preserved a great part of her innocence.
" Nastasia Borisovna, I have heard such confessions as
you want to make ; and it was hard for both of us , - for her

who spoke and for me who listened. I shall respect you not
less , but rather more , than before , when now I know that
you have endured a great deal ; but I understand the whole

story without listening.

Let us not speak about it ; there is

no need for you to confess before me .

I myself have spent

many years in great sorrows ; I am trying not to think about
them , and I don't like others to speak about them ; it's too
hard."

" No , Viéra Pavlovna ; I have a different feeling about it.
I want to tell you what a good man he is ; I want some one
to know how grateful I am to him ; and whom can I tell it
to if not to you ? What kind of a life I led, of course there
is no need of speaking about that,
it was of the same

stamp as that of all such poor creatures. I only want to tell
you how I became acquainted with him. It is so pleasant
for me to talk about him ; and besides , I am going to live in

his house, and you must know why I am going to leave the
shop."

" If telling this story will give you any pleasure, Anastasia Borísovna, I will gladly listen. Let me get my work
first ."

" Yes; but it is impossible for me to work. How kind
these girls have been, to let me have such work as agreed
with my health. I shall be grateful to them all, to each one.
Tell them , Viéra Pavlovna , that I asked you to thank them

for me . I was walking on the Nevsky, Viéra Pavlovna ; it
was rather early when I went out. A student was walking
along, and I accosted him. He did not reply, but crosses to
the other side of the street.

Then he sees that I am follow-

ing him ; I grasped him by the arm.

not going to let you go, you are such a handsome little fellow.' ' But I beg of you to let go of me,' he says. No,
come along with me.' ' I do not care to. ' ' Well, then, I
will go with you. Where are you going ? I shall not leave
you on any account ! ' I was such a shameless girl, much
worse than anybody else."
" Perhaps , from the very reason, Anastasia Borisovna,
that you were at heart more modest, more conscientious. "
" Yes , it may be so. At least, I have seen this in others ;
not at that time, of course , but afterwards , I understood it.

When I told him that I was going with him, at all events , he

laughed, and said, ' If you want to, come along ; but it will
be useless . '

He wanted to teach me a lesson, as he told me

afterwards ; it was disagreeable to him to have me clinging
to him. And so I went along, and I told him all sorts of
absurdities , but he kept silent ; and so we went to his rooms .

For a student he lived then very comfortably ; he used to
get from his pupils about twenty rubles a month, and he lived
all by himself. I stretched out on his sofa, and said : ' Nu,
where is your wine ? ' ' No,' says he, ' I shall give you no
wine ; but you can have tea, if you want.' ' With whiskey,'
I said. ' No, without whiskey.' I began to do all sorts of
foolish things, to be utterly shameless. He sat down and
looked at me ; but he did not show any interest, so offensive
was it to him. Nowadays you can find such young men,

And all the

time he addressed me formally [with vui, you] . He said,
You had better tell me who you are, and how you came to
do such things .' I began to tell him everything that came
into my mind. We make up stories to suit ourselves , and
that's the reason no one ever believes us ; but there are some ,
in spite of all that, whose stories are not made up ; there are

among us well-born and well-educated girls. He listened,
and said : ' No ; you have made up your story poorly. I
should like to believe it, but it is impossible.' At this time
we were drinking tea. And then he said : ' Do you know,

your constitution makes it bad for you to drink ? Your lungs

are already very much injured by it. Let me examine you.'
Well, Viéra Pavlovna, you won't believe me, but I assure
you that I felt ashamed, and yet what was my life ? and how
shamefully I had been behaving just a few minutes before !
-and he noticed it. 'Don't be disturbed,' he says ; ' I only
want to examine your lungs .' He was then only in the second class, but he knew a great deal about medicine ; he was
away ahead in science.

" He examined my chest. ' No,' says he, ' you must not
drink at all ; you have very weak lungs.' ' How can we
help drinking ? ' I asked.
We cannot get along without it.'
And it is really impossible, Viéra Pavlovna. ' Then you
must give up the life that you are leading.' ' Why should I
give it up ? It's such a gay life.' ' No,' says he, ' there's
very little gayety in it. Nu!' says he, ' I am very busy
now, and you had better leave me. ' And I left him, feeling
very angry because I had wasted my evening ; and I felt
very much offended because he was such a passionless
fellow, because we have our ambition in such matters , you
know.

" And then in a month it occurred to me to go to the same

place again.
Come on, ' says I, ' I'll go and see that
stick again ; I'll see if I can't wake him up.' This was just
before dinner. I had gone to bed the previous night, and I
had not been drinking ; he was sitting with a book.

' Hullo,

How do you do ? What do you want? '
Then I began again to do ridiculous things . I shall put
you out,' he says ;

You are not drunk now, and you can understand ; and you
had better heed what I say ; your face shows that you are
sicker than you were before ; you must give up wine ; just
fix your dress and we will have a little talk.' Well, the fact
was that my chest had already begun to pain me ; he examined me again ; he said that my lungs were in a worse state
than before ; he had a great deal to say ; yes, and my chest
did pain me, and so I began to get sentimental, and I burst
into tears. I did not want to die, and he was all the time
threatening me with consumption. And I say, ' How can I

give up my mode of life? My khozyáïka will not let me go.

I owe her seventeen silver rubles.' We were always kept in

A VITAL QUESTION.

debt, you know, so that we could not have any voice in the
matter. ' Nu !' says he, ' I have no seventeen silver rubles
with me, but you come and see me day after to-morrow.'
That seemed so strange, because I did not mean to give him
any hint ; and how could I have expected it ? I did not
believe my ears, and I wept still more violently, for I
thought he was making fun of me. ' It is a sin and a shame
to insult a poor girl when you see that she is weeping ' ; and
Idid not believe him for a long time, until at last I saw that
he was in earnest. And what do you think ? he raised the
money, and gave it to me two days later ; and even then I

somehow did not believe it. How is it you do this when
you do not want to take any favors from me ? ' I said. I
paid off my khozydika, and rented a separate room ; but I
had nothing to do, and I had no money. And so I went on
living as before, that is, not exactly as before ; what an
improvement it was, Viéra Pavlovna ! I used to receive
only my acquaintances , my good friends , those who did not
offend me .

And I had no wine either.

And therefore what

an improvement. And do you know how easy it was for me
in comparison with what it had been before ? no ; after all,
it was hard ; and I want to tell you this .

You know me ;

am I not a modest girl? Who ever hears anything bad of
me now ? And here in the shop how much care I take of the
children ! and they all love me ; and those old women cannot

say that I am teaching them anything bad. And so I lived
in this way. Three months or so went by, and during this
time I took good care of myself, because my life was peaceful ; and though I was ashamed on account of the money , I

did not look upon myself as a bad girl . Only at that time
Sáshenka used to come to see me, and sometimes I used to go
and see him . And now I am coming to speak of the subject
that I wanted to tell you about. He did not come to see me
as the others did , but he looked after me to see that I did not

return to my former weakness, or get to drinking wine. And
really the first days he helped me because I had a strong inclination for wine . And I was ashamed on his account ; sup-

posing he should come in and see that I was drinking ! And

possibly if it had not been for that, I should not have
resisted, because my friends, very good young fellows, used

215

A VITAL QUESTION.

to say, ' I am going to send out for wine ' ; but as I was
ashamed on his account, I used to say, ' No, it must not be.'
But otherwise I should have been tempted ; the mere thought
that wine was bad for me would not have been enough .

And then in three weeks or so I grew stronger ; my craving
for wine passed, and I got out of the habit of drinking.
And I kept laying up money to pay him back, and in two
months I paid him up. How glad he was that I returned
him the money. The day after he brought me some muslin
for a dress, and some other things that he bought with that
money.

He used to come to see me after that just as a

doctor calls to take care of an invalid .

And a month after

I had paid off my debt, he was sitting in my room, and said,

' Now, Nástenka, I begin to like your looks.'

And really,

it's true, wine spoils the complexion, and its effects don't

pass off suddenly; but by this time they had passed, and the
complexion of my face had become more delicate, and my
eyes were clearer ; and then again as I had got out of my

former habits, I began to speak modestly, for you know my
thoughts after I gave up drinking became modest, though I
used to get entangled in my speech, and sometimes I used
to forget myself on account of my former carelessness ; but
by this time I had got accustomed to behaving myself and
to speaking more modestly. And as soon as he said that I
pleased him, I was so happy that I wanted to throw myself
on his neck, but I did not dare, and I refrained.

And he

said, ' You see, Nástenka, I am not devoid of feelings .'
And he declared that I had become a nice modest young
girl, and he caressed me ; and how did he caress me ? He
took my hand and laid it on his, and began to smooth it with
his other hand ; and he looked at my hand, and indeed at

that time my hands were white and delicate. And so
when he took my hand -you would not believe it - I
blushed, after my life, Viéra Pavlovna, as though I had
been an innocent baruishna. This is strange, but it is so.
But with all my shame, - it is absurd to say, Viéra Pavlovna ,
with all my shame , it is true, - I still said, ' How is it that

you are willing to caress me, Aleksandr Matvéitch?

And he

said , ' It is because you are a virtuous girl now, Nástenka.'
And the words , ' virtuous girl,' that he called me , affected me

so much that I burst into tears. And then he said, ' What


======================================================================

216

A VITAL QUESTION.

is the matter, Nástenka ? ' and he kissed me. What do you
think ? When he kissed me, my head began to swim, and I
forgot all about the past ; is it possible to believe, Viéra
Pavlovna, that such a thing could happen to me after such a
life as mine ?

" Well, on the next morning, I was sitting and weeping ,

and wondering what would become of me, and how should I
live , poor creature that I was . All that was left for me was
to throw myself into the Neva. I felt that I could not live

such a life as I had been living ! I might die ; I might starve
to death ; but I could not live so any more . You see that I
had been in love with him long ago ; but, as he had not shown
any such feelings towards me, I had no hope of ever winning
his love, and my love died away within me, and I did not
even know that I had it. And now it was all brought to

light again ; and, of course, when you feel such a love, how
can you look upon anybody else with favor, except the man
whom you love ? You yourself know that this is impossible.
There is nothing else in existence except the one man. Here
I was sitting and weeping, What can I do now, being as I
have nothing to live on ? ' And I really made up my mind
to go and see him once more, and then go and drown myself.
And thus I spent the whole morning weeping.

But suddenly

I saw him coming in, and he began to kiss me, and he said,
Nástenka, do you want to live at my house ? ' And I told
him how I felt ; and so I went to live at his house.

That

was a happy time, Viéra Pavlovna ; I think that few have
ever enjoyed such happiness. And he was always so kind
to me. How many times it happened that I woke up, and
he was sitting with a book ; and then he would come and look
after me, and he would forget his book, and he would sit and
keep watch over me. But what a modest man he was , Viéra
Pavlovna ; I could understand it afterwards , when I came to
read and find out how love is described in novels ; I could

judge then . But, with all his modesty, how he loved me !
And what a feeling you have when a beloved man loves you .
It is a happiness such as you can form no idea of. Let us
imagine when he kissed me for the first time : my head even
turned ; I bowed before him. Such a feeling is sweet. indeed; but that was nothing in comparison to the feeling
afterwards . Before the blood boils , you know, there is anx-

iety ; and even in the sweet feeling there is more or less torment ; so that it is even hard to bear it, although it is hardly

worth while to say how blessed it is; because, for such a
minute, you are ready to sacrifice your life,- and there are
some who do sacrifice their lives , Viéra Pavlovna, - therefore
it must be a great happiness. But still it is not this , not this

at all. It is just the same as when you get lost in day-dreams
sometimes, when you are sitting alone, and merely think ,
'Akh ! how I love him ! ' and there is no worriment, no anx-

iety at all, in this pleasantness ; and you feel so calm, so
easy in mind ! So it is the same feeling , only a thousand-fold
stronger, when this beloved man loves you. And how calm
you feel ; and the heart does not throb, -no, for that would
mean disturbance, and you feel nothing of that kind, -but
it is much smoother, and there is more pleasantness ; and it
beats so gently, and your chest expands and you breathe
freer ! Akh ! this is so, this is true ; it is very easy to breathe !
akh ! how easy ! So that when an hour or two passes, like
one minute,

no , not a minute, not a second,

there is no

time at all, just as when you fall asleep and get up again.
If you fall asleep, you know that much time has passed since

you went asleep ; but how has the time passed ? It did not
make up a single minute. And then. again, it is the same
thing as after you have been asleep : there is no weariness ,
but, on the contrary, freshness , courage, as though you had
been resting ; and so it is : you have been resting. I said
that it was very easy to breathe, and that is the very
truth. What a strength in the glance, Viéra Pavlovna ! No
caresses of friends can caress you in such a way, or give you
such a sense of luxury, as his glance. All the rest that is in
love is not as comforting as this comfort.
" And how he loved me ! how he loved me !

Akh ! what

a delight it was ! No one can imagine it, except the one who
has experienced it. You know that, Viéra Pavlovna !
" You know , Viéra Pavlovna, that the look of even a
woman makes me blush ; our girls will tell you how bashful
I am .
It is for that reason that I live in a separate room ;

and how strange it is, you would scarcely believe it. But
you know all about it, and I need not tell you. But when
you think about it, you cannot part from this thought. No ;
I am going to leave you, Viéra Pavlovna ; there is nothing
more for me to tell you. I only wanted to tell you how good
Sáshenka is ."


======================================================================

A VITAL QUESTION.

XV .

NÁSTENKA finished telling her story to Viéra Pavlovna on
other days. She lived at Kirsánof's house about two years .
The signs of her threatening sickness seemed entirely to have
disappeared ; but at the end of the second year, when spring
came, consumption suddenly appeared in its full development .
The doctor thought that if she went away, she might count
on staving off her death for a long while. They decided to
part. To occupy her time in sedentary employment was also
sure destruction. It was necessary for her to look for occupation as a housekeeper, chambermaid, nurse-girl, or something of the kind, and with such a mistress as would not
impose trying duties upon her, and in such a way that there
should not be unpleasantness, and this was a very important
thing. These conditions were hard to meet ; but such a place
was found. Kirsánof had acquaintances among rising artists .
Through them Nástenka found a place as chambermaid with
one of the actresses in the Russian theatre, an excellent
woman .

As long as the actress remained on the stage, Nástenka
was well satisfied to live with her.

The actress was a refined

woman, and Nástenka valued her place ; it would be hard
to find another like it.

Nástenka became attached to her

because she never had any disagreeable scenes with her, and
the actress seeing this, became kinder than ever. Nástenka
lived a quiet life there, and her disease ceased, or almost

ceased, to develop. But the actress got married, renounced
the stage, and made her home in her husband's family. And
here , as Viéra Pavlovna had already heard before, the
actress's father-in-law began to affront the chambermaid .
Nástenka, let us suppose, was not subjected to temptation, but it occasioned a family quarrel ; the former actress
began to put the old man to shame ; the old man felt
the shame .

Nástenka did not want to be the cause of a

family disorder, and even if she had wanted, she could not

219

A VITAL QUESTION.

enjoy the peaceful life of her former situation, and she gave
it up.

That was about two years and a half since her parting
from Kirsánof. They had not seen each other at all during
this time. He called upon her, but the happiness of the
meeting affected her so unfavorably that he begged her not
to let him call upon her for her own sake.

Nástenka tried

to live as chambermaid in two or three families, but everywhere she found so many worriments and unpleasantnesses,
that it seemed better for her to become a seamstress, though
it was a direct step towards the development of her disease ;
the disease would have been developed from any such trying
position , and so it would be better for her to be subjected to

such a fate, but without the unpleasantness, and only from
her own work. A year of sewing entirely undermined
Nástenka's health. When she entered Viéra Pavlovna's
union, Lopukhóf, who was then the doctor for the shop, did

everything possible to stop the development of the consumption ; he did a great deal, that is , so far as a man with so
little real knowledge of medicine can do. But the end was
at hand.

Nástenka had enjoyed the delusion universal among those
who suffer from consumption, imagining that her disease was

not very far advanced, and so she did not seek to see
Kirsánof ; but for the last two months she had persistently
asked Lopukhóf whether she had long to live. Why she
wanted to know, she did not say, and Lopukhóf did not feel
that he had the right to tell her plainly about the approaching crisis , for he did not see in her question anything more
than the universal attachment to human life .

He tried to

calm her ; but she, as it often happens, could not be contented, for she kept aloof from that which might have given
her days a glimpse of happiness ; but now she herself saw
that she had not long to live, and her feelings were dominated by this thought : but the doctor assured her that she
must take care of herself.

She knew that she had to believe

more in him than in her own hopes, and therefore she did
not look to see Kirsánof.

Of course this doubt could not last long. According as
her last days approached, Nástenka's questions became
more persistent ; she either would have said that she had a

particular reason for knowing the truth, or Lopukhóf and
Viéra Pavlovna would have guessed that she had a particular


======================================================================

220

A VITAL QUESTION.

reason in her questions , and two or three weeks, or maybe

several days later, the result would have been the same as
really happened, owing to Kirsánof's unexpected appearance
in the shop.

But now the doubt was at an end ; not brought

by the further progress of her questions, but by this accidental circumstance .

" How glad I am, how glad I am ! I always have been
wanting to catch a sight of you , Sáshenka," said Nástenka,
when she took him to her room .

" Yes, Nástenka, I too am no less glad than you ; now
you shall not leave me again. Come back to my house,"
said Kirsánof, who was drawn away by a feeling of sympathy
and compassion ; but after he said this, it occurred to him,
" How could I have said that to her? She most likely is
not aware of the nearness of the crisis ."
But she either did not understand at first the sense that

could be drawn from these words , or she understood it, and

did not care to heed it ; and her gladness at seeing once
more the man whom she loved, deadened her grief at the
approaching end ; at all events, she simply showed her happiness by saying, " How kind you are ! How could I have

ever leftyou?"
But after he left she wept.

Only now she either under-

stood, or may have noticed that she had understood, what it
meant for her to see him once more .

" Well, it is of no use

for you to take care of yourself any longer, but at least you
shall enjoy the little of life that is left."
And indeed she was glad ; he never left her for a moment,
except those hours when he had to be in the hospital, or at
the medical school ; so she lived about a month, and he was

always with her. And how much they talked about everything ; what had happened since she had left his house, and
still further recollections about her past, and how many
pleasures she had ; he even took her out to ride ; he hired a

coupé, and he took her out every pleasant day into the suburbs of Petersburg, and she was greatly delighted. Nature
is so dear to a human being that even this pitiable, miserable
nature surrounding Petersburg, which cost millions and tens
of millions of rubles, people are delighted with ; he used to
read to her, and they played loto, and she even tried to play
chess , as though she had time to learn it.
Viéra Pavlovna sometimes spent late hours at their house

when returning from her walks , and still more often she used


======================================================================

A VITAL QUESTION.

221

to call on the invalid in the morning, to distract her thoughts
when she was alone, and when they were alone together ,
Nástenka had only one thing to tell her, how kind Aleksandr Matvéitch was, and how good, and how she loved him.
XVI .

FOUR months passed. The watching over Nástenka and
then his recollections about her deceived Kirsánof ; it seemed
to him that now he was out of danger as far as Viéra Pavlovna were concerned ; he did not avoid her when she came
to see Nástenka and stopped to talk with him ; and after-

wards when she tried to console him. As long as he
mourned for Nástenka, there was nothing in his feelings
towards Viéra Pavlovna except a friendly feeling of gratefulness towards her.

But , the reader has already learned to know what I mean
by but the same as he will always know beforehand what is
going to follow the pages that he has already read, - but, of
course, Kirsánof's feeling towards Nástenka had not been
the same as Nástenka's feelings towards him; he had long
ceased to feel love for her ; he only felt well disposed to her,
as towards a woman whom he had loved long before. His
former love towards her was only the thirst of a youth to
love some one , no matter whom .

Of course Nástenka was

not his equal, because they were not equal in mental development. When he ceased to be a youth, he could only feel
pity for Nástenka, and nothing more ; possibly he could be
tender to her, on account of old recollections and compassion, and that was all. His grief for her, in fact, was very
soon appeased ; but when his grief was a thing of the past,
he imagined that he was still occupied with it ; and after he
saw that he did not really feel any grief, but only recollections of it, he saw himself in such relations with Viéra

Pavlovna that he found that he was entrapped in a great
misfortune .

Viéra Pavlovna tried to distract him, and he gave himself
up to it, for he considered himself safe, or rather not realizing that he was falling in love with Viéra Pavlovna again,
or realizing that, by giving himself up to her care, he was
drifting towards misfortune. Well, and what happened now
in two or three months, after Viéra Pavlovna began to console him for his grief for Nástenka ? Nothing except the


======================================================================

fact that he used to spend almost every evening at the Lopukhófs ' , or escorted Viéra Pavlovna somewhere or other, fre-

quently with her husband, but more often by himself. That

was all that happened, but this was altogether too much, not
only for him, but also for her.

How did Viéra Pavlovna spend her days now ? Till evening
it was just the same as before.

Now, here it is six o'clock ;

at this time she usually goes alone to the shop, or she sits in
her room, and works by herself. But now, if she has to be
at the shop in the evening, Kirsánof was told about it the
evening before, and he comes to escort her. On their walk
to and from the shop, -by the way, it was not a very long
distance, - they talk about various matters, generally about
the union. Kirsánof himself is now the most active helper
there. Once there she occupies herself in giving directions,
and he too has a good deal to do ; for thirty girls ask not a
few questions and favors, which it is most convenient for

him to fulfil, isn't it? And during the intervals he sits and
talks with the children ; and here several of the young girls
take part in this conversation about everything in the world,
- about the beauty of the Arabian stories , the " Thousand
and One Nights," a good many of which he had already told
them, and about the white elephants which are so esteemed
in India, just as in our country a good many love white cats ;
half the company think that this is not good taste - white
elephants, cats, horses ; for all these are albinos, a sickly
species ; you can see by their eyes that they do not enjoy
such good health as the colored ones ; but the other part
of the company stand up for the white cats .
" And don't you know anything more about the life of
Mrs. Beecher Stowe, whose novel we have all known because

you told us ? " asked one of the growing girls . No ; Kirsánof, just now, does not know it, but he will find out about it ;
it is very interesting to him, but now he can tell them something about Howard who was almost as great as Mrs.
Beecher Stowe. Thus pass Kirsánof's talks, or Kirsánof's
discussions with the little flock ; one half of the flock , con-

sisting of children, has been constantly the same, but the
older half unceasingly changes. But now Viéra Pavlovna
has finished her business , and she returns home with him to
tea, and they all three sit for a long time after tea ; now
Viéra Pavlovna and her husband spend a much longer time
together than when Kirsánof was not there. Almost every


======================================================================

A VITAL QUESTION.

223

evening that they spend together, they have music for
an hour or two: Dmitri Sergéitch plays, Viéra Pavlovna
sings , Kirsánof sits and listens ; sometimes Kirsánof plays,
and Dmitri Sergéitch and his wife sing duets. But now
it often happens that Viéra Pavlovna hurries from the shop,
so as to have time to dress for the opera : now very often
they go to the opera, sometimes all together, and sometimes
Viéra Pavlovna and Kirsánofgo by themselves ; and besides ,
the Lopukhófs have company more often than before,-before

not counting the young folks ; for what kind of guests are
young folks ? they are only like nephews, - the Mertsálofs
were almost their only visitors ,- now the Lopukhófs have
made friends with two or three lovely families. The Mertsálofs and two other families made arrangements to have

every week, in their own circle, little evening parties with
dancing ; there used to be six couples, and even eight
couples , of dancers. Lopukhóf scarcely ever goes to the
opera or to these parties without Kirsánof ; but Kirsánof
very often escorts Viéra Pavlovna to these entertainments .

Lopukhóf says that he much prefers to stay at home in his
every-day coat on his sofa. And therefore, only about half
the evenings they spend together ; but these evenings they
are together with scarcely any interruptions ; it is true, when
the Lopukhófs have no company besides Kirsánof, the sofa
often draws Lopukhóf from the parlor, where the grand
piano stands ; the piano has now been brought from Viéra
Pavlovna's room into the parlor ; but this does not save
Dmitri Sergéitch very much. In a quarter or a half hour,
Kirsánof and Viéra Pavlovna give up the music, and sit by
his sofa ; however, Viéra Pavlovna does not sit long by the
sofa ; she quickly arranges herself comfortably on the sofa
itself, but in such a way that there is plenty of room for her
husband also ; for the sofa is wide ; that is, there is not any
too much room, but she would throw her arm around her
husband , and so it is comfortable for him to stay there .
And thus passed three months or more.

The idyl is no longer fashionable, and I myself do not like
it at all ; that is, personally I do not like it, just as I do not
like sauntering, do not like asparagus- several things , aren't
there, that I am not fond of? but it is impossible for any one
man to like all dishes and all ways of amusement. But I
know that these things , which are not according to my personal taste, are very good things; that they are to the taste,


======================================================================

224

A VITAL QUESTION.

or they would be to the taste of a vastly greater number of
people than those who, like me, prefer chess-playing to sauntering, sauerkraut with hemp oil to asparagus. I even know
that the tastes of the majority which does not share my enjoyment in chess-playing, would be glad not to share my taste
for sauerkraut with hemp oil, are not worse than mine ; and
so I say : let there be in the world as many amusements as
possible, or let them almost absolutely vanish from the world,
but let sauerkraut with hemp oil remain, as an antiquarian
rarity for a few such odd fellows as I.

And, likewise, I know that for the huge majority of people,
who are not in the least worse than I am, happiness must
have an idyllic character ; and I exclaim : " Let the idyl begin to reign over all the other characters in life. " For a few
originals who are not fond of it there will be other forms of

happiness ; but the majority must have the idyl. As to the
fact that the idyl is not in fashion, and therefore people shun
it, that is no objection at all ; they shun it just as the fox in
the fable shunned the grapes. It seems to them that the idyl
is inaccessible, and therefore they lay down their dictum :
" Let it not be in fashion . "

But it is pure absurdity that the idyl is inaccessible ; it is
not only a good thing for almost all people, but it is very
feasible ; there ought to be no hardship in arranging it, only
it must not be for one person, or ten persons, but for all.
Now the Italian opera is an impossible thing for five people ;
but for the whole city of Petersburg it is very possible, as all
see and hear. And so, too, the " Collected Writings of N. V.
Gogol, Moscow, 1861," would be an impossible thing for
ten people ; but for the whole public it is very possible,
and not expensive, as we all know. But as long as there is
no opera for the whole city, it is possible for only a few very
music-mad people to enjoy themselves at second-class concerts ; and as long as the second volume of " Dead Souls " 1
was not printed for the whole public, only a few of the most
eager admirers of Gogol, not valuing the labor, prepared each
for themselves manuscript copies . A manuscript is incomparably worse than a printed book ; a second-class concert
is very poor compared to an Italian opera ; but both the one
and the other are good in their way.
1 One of Gogol's last acts was to burn up the concluding portion of his great story,

" Dead Souls," the first part of which appeared in 1842. A few chapters of the second part were found after his death ; but a certain Dr. Zakhartchenko, of Kief, wrote
aconclusion, which was much ridiculed.


======================================================================

A VITAL QUESTION.

225

XVII .

IF a stranger had consulted Kirsánof about the position in
which Kirsánof found himself after he came to his senses ,

and if Kirsánof had been a perfect stranger to all the people
who were concerned in the matter, he would have said to the
one who came to consult with him : " To straighten out this

affair by running away is too late. I do not know how the
play will end, but for you to run or to stay is equally dangerous ; but for those for whose peace you care, your running
away would be still more dangerous than your remaining.”
Of course Kirsánof would have said this only to a man
like himself, or like Lopukhóf, to a man of firm character
and undoubted virtue. To other people it would be useless
to give advice about such a situation, because these other

people invariably act in such cases meanly and contemptibly ;
they put the woman to shame ; they dishonor themselves,
and then go out into their own society, and whimper or
boast, and take delight in their heroic virtue , or their amor-

ous irresistibility. With such people neither Kirsánof nor
Lopukhóf liked to talk about the way that men of generous
character should act. But Kirsánof would have been right
in telling any one his dictum that to run away now would be
worse than to remain. It would have been to imply, " I
know how you would act if you remained ; you would act in
such a way as not to expose your feelings, because only in
this way you will not do ill by remaining. The task before
you is so far as possible not to disturb the tranquillity of a
woman whose life runs smoothly. But it appears that it is
already impossible not to disturb it. The feeling that is
incompatible with her present relations is already, according to all probability, or rather, to use simpler language,
already, without any doubt, engendered in her, but as yet
she does not know it. Whether it will spring up soon or
not by herself without any interference on your part is

uncertain . But your avoidance of her would be the very
thing to call it out. Consequently your going away would
only be to hasten the matter, a thing which you want to
avoid ."

But Kirsánof argued the case not as a stranger but as a

participant. It seemed to him that to go away would be
harder than to remain; the feeling impels him to remain ;


======================================================================

226

A VITAL QUESTION.

consequently would not to remain be the same thing as to
yield to the feeling, to be tempted by its suggestions ?
What right had he to believe so absolutely that neither by
words nor by looks he would not betray his feeling, would
not bring it forth? And therefore it would be wiser to go
away. In your own case it is very difficult to distinguish
how far reason is tempted by the sophisms of inclination,
because uprightness says, act, fight against temptation, then
you have better chances for noble action. This is a translation from the language of theory into every-day speech ;
but the theory to which Kirsánof adhered, considers such
lofty words as nobleness, to be ambiguous, obscure, and
Kirsánof in his terminology would have expressed himself
thus : " Every man is an egotist ; so am I ; now the question
comes up, ' Is it more profitable for me to go away, or to

remain ? ' If I go away, I crush in me my personal feeling ;
if I remain, I am liable to disturb my feeling of human
dignity by some stupid word or look which may be caused
by this individual feeling. The individual feeling may be
crushed ; and by and by my peace of mind may be again
restored ; I may be again satisfied with my life. But if I
once act against my human nature, I shall lose forever the
possibility of peace, the possibility of self-satisfaction ; I
shall poison all my life. My position is like this : I am
fond of wine, and before me is a flask with very good wine ;
but I have a suspicion that this wine is poisoned. I cannot
tell whether my suspicion is well founded or not. Must I
drink this flask of wine, or shall I pour it out so as not to be
tempted by it. I must not call my decision either noble or
even virtuous , these are too high words ; I must simply call
it coldly calculating common sense. I throw away the
flask . Thus I deprive myself of some pleasure ; I cause
myself some displeasure ; but by doing so I secure my
health, that is, the possibility of having a great deal of such
wine to drink, which I shall surely know is not poisoned.
I simply do not act foolishly, and that is all the praise that
I deserve ."

But how could he withdraw ? His former game of making

believe offended, of exhibiting some mean feature of his
character so as to depend upon it, would not work ; twice to
perform the same trick is impossible ; a second performance
like the first would only have revealed the design of the first ,

would have shown him up as the hero not only of the new,
but also of the former affair. Yes ; and generally speaking,
it is necessary to avoid any abrupt cessation of relations .
Such an avoidance would be easier, but it would be theatrical ; it would arouse attention, that is, at the present time

it would be mean and contemptible, or, according to Kirsánof's theory of egotism, it would be a stupid miscalcu-

lation.

And so there remained only one, and the most

tormenting means, that is, an unobtrusive renunciation carried out in a slow and unnoticeable manner, so that it might
not be seen that he was giving them up. This action is
very difficult ; it requires great tact to disappear from sight
so that your motion is not noticed, when you are watched
by bright eyes ; but it could not be helped ; he had to do in
this way. However, according to Kirsánof's theory, it was
not tormenting at all, but rather agreeable ; for the harder a

deed is to accomplish, the gladder you are (on the selfish
theory) at the strength and skill which you have shown while
successfully accomplishing it.
And, indeed, he fulfilled it successfully ; he did not betray
his attention by one word too much or one word too little, or
by a look ; as before, he was free and jocular with Viéra
Pavlovna ; as before, he made it evident that he enjoyed her
society, but there appeared various things to hinder his coming to the Lopukhófs' as often as before, or remaining there
a whole evening as before, and the result was that Lopukhóf
had to seize him more often than before, by his arm or
the lappel of his coat, with the words, " No, old fellow, you
can't get rid of this discussion so easily " ; and by far the
larger part of the time that Kirsánof spent at the Lopukhófs'
he tried to stay by his friend's sofa. And everything was
arranged so gradually that it was not noticed at all how the
change was developing. Interruptions came along, and Kirsánof not only brought them up as excuses, but, moreover,


======================================================================

228

A VITAL QUESTION.

was sorry (this did not happen every time, for too great show
of sorrow would not do) that such an interruption happened.
And these interruptions seemed to be so natural, so unavoid-

able, that the Lopukhófs themselves pushed him from the
house reminding him that he had forgotten his promise to be
at home , because such and such an acquaintance, whom he

ought to see, was coming to his house. Or he forgot that if
he did not call to-day on such and such a person, such and
such a person would be offended ; or he had forgotten that
he ought to work for at least four hours, and ought he not to
sleep a little to-night in preparation for it ? Why, it's ten
o'clock already, and he must not talk any more ; he must go
and take up his work. Kirsánof, moreover, did not always
listen to them when they reminded him; he would not go to
see his acquaintances, he would let his friend get angry, or the
work would not run away, so he would spend the evening with

them. But these interruptions kept growing more frequent,
and scientific operations began to steal unmercifully one evening after another from Kirsánof. They might go to the
deuce, according to his opinion (and sometimes he used to
say this aloud) ; that is, his scientific occupations or his acquaintances have been imposing upon him more than usual ;
how they did impose upon him ! (This also he used to say
aloud.) And so it seemed to him and the Lopukhófs saw
very well how it was - that he was getting to be very popular,
and so there always came up more and more people to whom
he was necessary ; and then he must not treat his work carelessly, for there was no excuse for his being so lazy; and,
indeed, he had been very lazy during the last few months ,
and it would be hard for him to begin work again ; " But
you must work, brother Aleksandr," and she would say,
" It's time, Aleksandr Matvéitch."
The manœuvre was a difficult one ; for week after week it

was necessary to prolong this wheeling " to the left and
around, " and the turn was made so slowly, so steadily, like
the hands of a clock. Look at it as attentively as you please ;
you cannot see that it is turning, but it does its work silently ;

it steadily goes away from its former position. And what
pleasure Kirsánof, as a theorist, had in watching his skill in
putting this into practice. Egotists and materialists act only

for their own pleasure ! And Kirsánof, laying his hand on
his heart, could say that he was playing this game only for

his own pleasure. He delighted in his skill and his boldness .

Thus passed a month, and maybe somewhat more ; and
if any one had reckoned, he would have found that during

this month his friendliness to the Lopukhófs had not diminished a hair's breadth ; but fourfold less time he spent with
them, and simultaneously he reduced to almost a half the
time that he used to spend with Viéra Pavlovna. One
month more, and while their former friendship still remained,
the friends would see each other but little, and the thing
would have its hat on .

Lopukhóf's eyes were sharp ; don't they really see anything ? No ; not a thing.
But Viéra Pavlovna ? and Viéra Pavlovna notices nothing .

But does she notice no change in herself? Viéra Pavlovna
notices no change in herself. Only Viéra Pavlovna dreams
a dream .

XIX .

VIÉRA PAVLOVNA'S THIRD DREAM.
AND Viéra Pavlovna dreams a dream .

After tea, she had a talk with her milenki, and went to
her room to lie down , - not to sleep ; it was too early to

sleep. Why, it was only half-past nine ; no, she did not
even undress ; she only lay down to read. And here she is
reading as she lies on her little bed ; but the book falls
away from her eyes, and Viéra begins to think : " What is
the reason that lately I have been feeling lonesome occasionally ; or not exactly lonesome, or does it merely seem so ?
No ; it is not lonesome, but I only just happened to remember that I wanted to go to the opera this evening ; but this
Kirsánof, attentive fellow that he is, went too late to get
tickets ; he might have known that when Bosio is singing,
it is impossible to get two-ruble tickets at eleven o'clock.
Of course he cannot be blamed ; he must have been work-

ing till five o'clock, surely till five o'clock, though he didn't
confess it ; and yet he is to blame.

No ; after this , I'd bet-

ter ask the milenki to get tickets, and I guess I'd better go

A VITAL QUESTION.

to the opera with my milenki, too ; mílenki would never be
so stupid as to let me go without tickets, and he is always
glad to go with me ; my milenki is such a sweet fellow !
And on account of this Kirsánof, I have missed hearing
' Traviata.' I would go every night to the opera, if there
were opera, no matter how bad it might be, provided only
Bosio sang the chief role ; if I had such a voice as Bosio, it
seems to me I would sing all day long. I wonder if I could
get acquainted with her. How could I manage it? That
artillerist is well acquainted with Tamberlík.¹ Could it be
done through him ? No ; it is impossible ; what an absurd
thought ! What is the good of getting acquainted with
Bosio ?

Would she sing for me ? Of course she has to save

her voice .

" And how did Bosio succeed in learning Russian ?

How

purely she pronounces ! But what absurd words ! Where
could she have found such wretched poetry ? Yes ; she
must have studied out of the same grammar which I did ;
those verses were quoted in it to illustrate the use of quotation marks. How stupid it is to quote such verses in a
grammar ! though it would not be so bad if the poetry were
better ; but there is no need of thinking about the meaning
of the verses ; all one needs to do is to hear her sing :

-

' The hours of pleasure
Make the most of ;

The years of youth
Give up to love.' 2

" What ridiculous poetry ! wrong accent in the second line :
make the most of! of, uv !

But what a voice and what feel-

ing she puts into her singing ; and her voice is vastly
sweeter than it used to be - incomparably better ! It is
wonderful ! How could it improve so much? And here I
was wondering how I could get acquainted with her, and she
herself has come to call upon me. How did she find out
that I wanted her to ? "

" Yes ; you came to call on me a long time ago," says
Bosio, and she speaks Russian .

" I called upon you, Bosio ? How could I have called

upon you when I was not acquainted with you ? But I am
very, very glad to see you. "
Viéra Pavlovna pushed aside her bed-curtain, so as to give
Bosio her hand ; but the cantatrice laughs, and it seems that
it is not Bosio at all, but de Merrick in the role of the gypsy
" Rigoletto " ; only the gayety of the laughter is de Merrick's, but the voice is still Bosio's, and she runs away and
hides herself behind the bed-curtain. How disagreeable,
that this bed-curtain hides her - and before there was no

bed-curtain at all : where did it come from ?

" Do you know why I came to you? " And she laughs,
as though she were de Merrick and at the same time Bosio.

"Who are you ? You are not de Merrick, are you ? "
" No."

" Are you Bosio ? "
The songstress laughs . " You learn rapidly ; but now it
will be necessary for us to attend to what brought me here.
I want to read your diary with you."
" I do not keep a diary ; I never kept one ."
" Look here ; what is that lying on this little table ? "
Viéra Pavlovna looks ; on the table near the bedstead is

lying a copy-book with the inscription, " V. L.'s Diary."
Where did this copy-book come from ? Viéra Pavlovna
takes it, opens it ; the book is written in her own hand but when ?

" Read the last page," says Bosio .
Viéra Pavlovna reads : " Again I am often obliged to
stay alone whole evenings . But that's nothing ; I am used
to it."
" Is that all ? " asks Bosio .
" That's all. "

" No ; you did not read it all."

" There is nothing more written there."
"You cannot deceive me," says the visitor.

" What is

this?"

From behind the bed-curtain comes forth a hand ; what a

handsome hand ! No ; this wonderful hand does not belong
to Bosio, and how does this hand come out from the curtain
without pushing it apart ?

The hand of the new visitor touches the page ; from under
the hand appear new lines, which were not there before.
" Read ," says the visitor.

And Viéra Pavlovna's heart begins to feel oppressed ; she

has never seen these lines before ; she did not know that

they were written, but her heart is oppressed.

She does not

wish to read the new lines . " Read," repeats the visitor.
Viéra Pavlovna reads : “ No ; it is tiresome for me to be

alone.

Once I did not feel the loneliness. Why is it tire-

some for me now when it did not used to be ? "

"Turn back a page," says the visitor. Viéra Pavlovna
turns a page : -

" The summer of this year ! "
" Who writes diaries like that ? " thinks Viéra Pavlovna ;
" it should have been written, 1885 , June or July ,' and have

the day of the month ; but here it stands ' : ' The summer
of this year ' ; who keeps diaries in that way?"
" The summer of this year ; we go picnicking in our
usual way into the suburbs, to the islands, and this time
milenki goes along with us. How enjoyable it is to me ! Akh ! so it is August, is it? What day of the month ? the
fifteenth ; or , no, the twelfth ?

Yes , yes , it was about the fif-

teenth ; it was after that excursion that my poor milenki became sick," thinks Viéra Pavlovna.
" Is that all ? "
" That's all ."

" No, you don't read everything. What is this ? " says
the visitor, and again through the unparted bed-curtain

comes the wonderful hand ; and again it touches the pages,
and again on the pages appear new words, and again Viéra
Pavlovna reads against her will the new words, " Why
doesn't my milenki come along with us oftener ? "
" Turn one leaf more," says the visitor.

" My milenki has so much to do, and it is all for my sake ;
for my sake he is working, my milenki ; - and that is the
answer, " thinks Viéra Pavlovna, happy at the thought.
" Turn one page more."

" What honest, noble people these students are, and how
they respect my milenki. And I enjoy myself with them just
as though they were brothers, and we have no ceremoniousness ."

Is that all ? "
" That is all ! "

" No , read further."

And again appears the hand and touches the page, and
again come forth new lines, and again Viéra reads the new
lines : -

" The sixteenth of August - that is on the second day
after our visit to the island ; no, it was exactly the fifteenth,"

thinks Viéra Pavlovna : " all the time the milenki spoke with
that Rakhmétof, or as they called him out of jest, the rigorist, and his comrades , but he spent hardly quarter of an hour
with me. - That is not true ; he spent nearly half an hour
with me ," thinks Viéra Pavlovna, “ besides the time when we

were sitting together in the boat."
" The seventeenth of August ; yesterday the students
spent a whole evening with us ." Yes , it was on the evening when the milenki was taken sick - Milenki talked with
them the whole evening long. Why did he spend so much
time with them and so little with me ? He is not working all
the time ; he himself says that he is not working all the time ;
that without rest it is impossible to work ; that he takes a
great deal of rest, that he thinks about nothing else except

taking a rest ; why does he think by himself and not with
me ?"

" Turn over one leaf more."

" July of the present year and every month of the present
year, and until mílenki became sick, then last year and before that too. Five days ago the students called on us, and
yesterday too. I carried on with them, it was so gay. Tomorrow or day after to-morrow they will call again, and again
it will be gay."
" Is that all ? "
" That is all ! "

" No , read further."

Again appears the hand, touches the page, and again from
under the hand come new lines ; and again against her will
Viéra Pavlovna is reading them :

" The beginning of the present year, especially at the end
of spring . Yes, it used to be gay with these students, but
that was all.

But now I often think it was childish non-

sense ; such nonsense will amuse me for a long time yet.
Probably even when I have come to be an old woman, when I
myself will not be of the age for playing, I shall delight in the

Viéra Pavlovna, and to enjoy one's self like Viérotchka is
only agreeable at times, but not always. Viéra Pavlovna
sometimes wants such happiness that she might still remain

equals in life."

" Turn back several pages more."
" I have opened a sewing union, and went to Julie to ask
for orders . Milenki stopped at her rooms to get me. She
kept us to breakfast and she ordered champagne, and she

forced me to drink two glasses. We began to sing, run,
shout, wrestle ; how gay it was ! Milenki looked on and
laughed."
" Is that really all ? " asks the visitor, and again appears
the hand, and again from under the hand appear new words,
and again Viéra Pavlovna reads against her will : -

" Milenki only looked on and laughed. Why didn't he
join in with us ? That would have made it still gayer. Was
it that it was improper, or didn't he care to take a part in

might have done it ! But he has such a nature. He not only
does not interfere ; he also approves, but that is all. "
" Turn one page back."

" Read it all ."

" There is nothing more to read."
" Look ! "

Again from under the visitor's hand appear new lines.
" I do not want to read," says Viéra Pavlovna, in fear.
She has not yet distinguished what is written in those new
lines , but already it is horrible to her.
" You cannot help reading, when I bid you to read.
Read !"

Viéra Pavlovna reads : -

" Do I only love him because he led me out from the cellar- not himself, but my salvation from the cellar ? "
" Just turn back once more, and read the very first page."
" It is my birthday, to-day ; to-day I spoke for the first
time with D. , and fell in love with him. I never before heard
such noble and consoling words from any one. How he sym-

pathizes with everything that demands sympathy, wants to
help everything that needs help ! How sure he is that happiness is possible for all people, that it must be, and that anger
and woe are not forever ; that a new and bright life is rapidly
approaching us ! How joyfully my heart expanded when I
heard these assurances from this learned and serious man ,

for they confirmed my own thoughts. How kind he was when
he spoke about us poor women ! Every woman would love
such a man. How clever he is ! how generous ! how kind ! "
" Good! Turn again to the last page."
" But I have read that page ! "

" No ; that is not the last one yet. Turn one leaf more."
" But there is nothing on this leaf ! "
" Just read ! Do you see how much is written on it ? "

THE next morning, Dmitri does not go to call his wife to

can be the matter with her ? what frightened her so ? what
caused that dream ? "

" Stay here, Viérotchka ; I will bring thee thy tea here.
Don't get up, my dear little girl.¹ I will bring it to you, and
you can wash your face and not get up."
" No, I will not get up ; I will lie awhile, it is so comfortable for me here. How smart you are, milenki ! and how I
love thee ! And now I have washed my face, and now thou
canst bring the tea here. No ; first take me into thy arms."
And Viéra Pavlovna long holds her husband in her embrace.

to come running to your room ? What will Masha think now ?

I am going to love thee as I never loved thee before."
Viéra Pavlovna's room is empty now. Viéra Pavlovna,
without any concealment from Masha, has moved to her husband's apartment. " How tender he is, how kind, my mílenki ! and I could imagine that I did not love thee ! How
absurd I am ! "

" Viérotchka, now that you are calmed down, tell me
what you dreamed day before yesterday."

"Akh ! what nonsense ! I only dreamed, as I told you,
that you caressed me very little ; but now it is good. Why
didn't we always live this way ? Then I should not have
dreamed that horrible dream ; it was dreadful, disgusting !
I don't like to think about it ."

" Whom do you mean by ' she ' ? Have you found some
new friend beside your former ' beauty ' ? "
" Yes , I have.

Some woman or other called on me with

such a fascinating voice, much finer than Bosio's, and what
lovely hands she had ! Akh ! what wonderful beauty ! but
all that I could see of her was her hand ; she, herself, was

hidden behind the bed-curtain ; I dreamed that at my bedside, and that was the reason I gave up that bed ; because I
had such a dream in it. There was a bed-curtain , and that
my ' visitor ' hid herself behind it ; but what a wonderful

hand she had, my dear ; and she sang about love, and she
revealed to me what the meaning of love was : now, I
understand , my dear. What a stupid little thing I was be-

cause I did not understand; I was a mere girl, a foolish little girl."

" My dear, my angel, everything has its time. The way
we lived before was love, and the way that we live now is
love ; some people must have one kind of love, others
another. Hitherto the one kind of love satisfied you ; now
you need another. Now you are a woman, my dear, and
what you did not want then, you must have now . "
A week or two pass. Viéra Pavlovna makes herself comfortable .

She is in her own room now, only when her hus-

band is not at home, or when he is working, or rather when
he is working she often sits in his library ; when she sees
that she disturbs him, that his work requires his full attention, then she does not interrupt him. But such work does
not often come along ; for the most part, it is scientific work,
which is entirely mechanical, and accordingly three-fourths
of the time he has his wife by his side, and at times they
caress each other.

But one contrivance was necessary ;

they had to buy another sofa a little smaller than the husband's .

And so Viéra Pavlovna, after dinner, ensconces

herself in her little sofa ; ¹ and her husband sits by her little
sofa, and takes delight in looking at her.
" My dear, why do you kiss my hand ? You know I don't
like it ."

" Oh ! I forgot that you considered it an affront ; well,

saved me from bad people, and you have saved me from
myself. Caress me, my dear ; caress me ! "

A month passes . Viéra Pavlovna after dinner ensconces
herself comfortably on her wide, little, soft divantchik in her

sat down on her little sofa, and she threw her arms around
his neck ; she bent her head to his bosom, but she is lost in

thought ; he kisses her, but her melancholy does not pass
away, and her eyes are almost ready to shed tears.

" Viérotchka, my dear, what makes you so pensive ? "
Viéra Pavlovna weeps, but she says nothing . " No ,"
she wipes away her tears. -" No, don't caress me, dear !
That's enough ; thank thee."

ately and frankly at him.

And she looks so affection-

" Thank thee, thou art so kind to

me! "

" Kind, Viérotchka ? What is it? what do you mean ? "
" Yes , kind, my dear ; thou art kind."
Two days pass .

Viéra Pavlovna again ensconces herself

comfortably after dinner ; no, she is not comfortable, but
she is lying and thinking ; and she is lying in her own room,
on her own bed. Her husband is sitting near her with his
arm around her ; and he also is lost in thought.

" No, it is not this ; it is not my fault," thinks Lopukhóf.
" How kind he is ; how ungrateful I am ! " thinks Viéra

Pavlovna. And that is what they think.
She says, " My dear, go to your room and work, or else
take a rest," and she tries to say, and succeeds in saying,
these words in a natural and not melancholy tone.
" Why do you drive me away, Viérotchka ? It is pleasant
for me here, " and he tries to say these words, and he succeeds in saying these words, in a natural and jocular tone .
" No, go away, my dear ; you have done enough for me.

Go, and get rested."
He kisses her, and she forgets her thoughts, and again it
is sweet and easy for her to breathe.
" Thank you , dear," she says .

And Kirsánof is perfectly happy. The struggle has been
pretty hard this time, but how much inward satisfaction it
afforded him ! and this satisfaction will never pass away,

though the struggle will soon be over ; but it will warm his
heart for a long day, till the end of his life. He is honorable.

Yes, he has harmonized them ; yes , in reality, he has

brought them into harmony. Kirsánof is lying on his sofa ;

A VITAL QUESTION.

he is smoking and thinking, " Be honest, that means be prudent ; don't make any miscalculation ; remember the axiom :
remember that the whole is greater than any of its parts ;
that is, that your human nature is stronger, is more important for you than every other individual tendency ; and
therefore treasure its benefits above those which may come

from any separate tendency of thine, if they prove to be

anyway inconsistent with the whole, and that's all ; and that
means be honest, and all will be well. One rule, and how
commonplace it is, and that is the whole result of science ;
and that completely fills the volume of the laws of a happy
life. Yes , happy are those who are born with the capability
of understanding this simple rule. In this respect, I am
very fortunate. Of course I am very much indebted to
training, more probably than to nature. But gradually it
will develop into a general rule, which will be the result of
the universal training and circumstances of life.

Yes , then

it will be easy for everybody to live in this world, just as it
is for me now . Yes , I am satisfied ; yet I must go and call
on them.

I have not been there for three weeks ; it's time,

even though it may be unpleasant for me. I am not drawn
there any more at all ; but it's time. Some of these days I
will stop in there for half an hour, or would it not be better

to postpone it for a month ? It seems to me that I can.
Yes, my retreat has been well managed ; my manœuvres are
at an end ; I have passed from their sight, and now they will
not notice whether it's three weeks or three months since I

have been to call on them. And it is agreeable to think,
when you are away, about people towards whom you have
acted uprightly. Now I shall rest on my laurels."
And Lopukhóf in two or three days later still, also after
dinner, comes into Viérotchka's room, takes his wife in his
arms and carries her to her ottoman in his room.

" Rest

here, dear ! " And he takes delight in looking at her. She
fell asleep smiling ; he is sitting and reading ; and she
opened her eyes and thinks : --

" How his room is decorated ! there is nothing in it except
what is absolutely necessary. Yet he has his own tastes ;

there's a big box of cigars, which I gave him last year ; he
has not opened it yet ; it's waiting its time. Yes, it's his
only pleasure, his own only luxury - cigars. No, he has no
other, -the photograph of that old man ; what a splendid face


======================================================================

241

A VITAL QUESTION.

that old man has ! what a mixture of kindness and vigilance
in his eyes and in the whole expression of his face ! what

trouble Dmitri took to get this photograph ! for Owen's
photographs are not to be had. He wrote three letters , two
of his letters did not reach the old man ; the third one
reached him, and how long he tormented him before he suc-

ceeded in getting this really superb photograph, and how
happy Dmitri was when he got it, together with a letter from

the Saintly old man,' as he calls him, in which Owen, as
he says , praised him. And here is still another luxury : my

portrait ; half a year he laid up money for the sake of getting a good artist, and how he and the young artist bothered
me. Two pictures and that's all. Would it cost much to
buy a few engravings and photographs just as I have in my
room ? And he has no flowers, while I have quantities in
my room. Why shouldn't he like flowers as well as I do ?
Is it because I am a woman ? What nonsense ! Or is it
because he is a serious and scientific man ? But Kirsánof

has flowers and engravings, and he too is a serious. scientific man. And why does he hate to give up his time to
me ?

I know that it costs him a real effort !

Is it because

he is a serious, scientific man ? But here's Kirsánof. No !
no ! he's kind, kind ! he has done everything for me, he is

always ready to do anything to gratify me. Who can love
me as he does ? And I love him and I am ready for anything for his sake - "

" Viérotchka ! you are not sleeping, dear ! "
" My milenki , why haven't you any flowers in your room ? "
" Very well, dearest, I will get some to-morrow. It
simply did not occur to me that it was a good thing. But it
is very nice."
" And what was it that I wanted to ask you about besides ?

Oh, yes ! do get some photographs ; or rather, I'm going to
buy you some flowers and photographs ."
" Then they will surely be agreeable to me. I like them
for themselves, but then they will be still more delightful to
me. But, Viérotchka, you are getting blue again ; you have
been thinking about your dream. Will you allow me to ask
you to tell me something more about the dream that frightened you so much ? "

" My dear, I have not been thinking about it at all.
so painful for me to think about it. "

It is

A VITAL QUESTION.

" But, Viérotchka, maybe it would be well for me to know
about it ."

" Very well, my dearest ! I dreamed that I was bored
because I had not gone to the opera, and I was thinking
about Bosio ; some woman seemed to call on me , and at first

I thought it was Bosio, but she kept hiding from me ; she
compelled me to read my diary ; and there was nothing in it
except how we loved each other ; but when she touched her
hand to the pages, new words seemed to be which said that
I did not love you."
" Forgive me, dearie,¹ for asking one thing more. Was
that all that you saw in your dream ? "
" My dearest, if that had not been all, wouldn't I have
told thee so ? And I have already told thee all. "
This was said so tenderly, so sincerely, so simply, that
Lopukhóf felt in his heart a wave of warmth and sweetness ,

such as one who has once experienced this joy will never
forget till his dying day. Oh, how pitiful that only a few, a

very few, husbands can have this feeling ! All the pleasures
of happy love are nothing in comparison with it ; it fills the
human heart with the purest content, the holiest pride.
In Viéra Pavlovna's words, which were spoken with a shade
of melancholy, rang a reproach, but the significance of the
reproach was this : " My dear, don't you know that I have
perfect confidence in you ? A wife may hide from her husband the mysterious motions of her soul ; such are those

very relations in which they stand to each other. But you,
my dear, have so behaved that there has never been any

need of hiding things from you, that my heart is open before
you as before my own eyes.”
This is a great merit in a husband ; this great reward is

purchased only by a high moral worth, and whoever has
deserved it has a right to look upon himself as a man of
unquestionable nobility ; he may boldly hope that his conscience is pure and will always remain pure, that his manhood will never play him false, that in all trials of every sort
he will remain calm and firm, that fate is not reigning over
the peace of his soul, that from the time that he has de-

served this great honor, to the very last moment of his life,
disregarding whatever shocks to which he may be subjected ;
he will be happy in the consciousness of his worthy manhood.
Now we know enough of Lopukhóf to see that he was not

a sentimental man, but he was so touched by these words of
his wife that his face burned : -

" Viérotchka, my dearest, you have reproached me."
His voice for the second and last time in his life trembled.
The first time that his voice trembled it was from doubt

arising from conjecturing his position ; now it trembled from
pleasure. " You have reproached me, but this reproach is
dearer to me than all the words of love. I offended you with
my question, but how happy I am that my bad question gave
me, brought me, such a reproach.

Look, there are tears in

my eyes, the first tears that I have shed since I was a boy !"
The whole evening long he scarcely took his eyes from
her, and she never once thought that he was making an

effort to appear tender to her ; and this evening was one of
the happiest of her life, at least, up to the present time.

Several years after the time of which I am now telling you
about her, she will have a good many such days, months,
years ; this will be when her children shall have grown up,
and she will find in them people worthy of happiness and
sure of it. This pleasure is higher than all other individual
pleasures ; whatever may appear in any other personal pleasure is a rare and transitory loftiness ; with her it is an

ordinary, every-day level of happiness.

But this is in the

future which will come to her.

XXI .

Bur after his wife had gone to sleep sitting on his knees ,

after he laid her down on her little sofa, Lopukhóf began to
think seriously about her dream. It was not his affair
whether she loved him or not ; that was her concern, over
which he had no control , and over which as he himself

plainly saw, he had no control. This will settle itself; there
is no need of thinking about it to-day ; let time tell ; but now
there is no time for it ; it is now his business to find out

what is the cause of her foreboding that she does not love
him.

For the first time he sat a long while in these thoughts ;
already for the last few days he has seen that he is not
retaining her love for him . A great loss ; but what could be
done about it? If he could exchange his nature, acquire a

tendency towards that gentle fondness which her nature
demanded, then of course it would be a different thing. But


======================================================================

244

A VITAL QUESTION.

he saw that such an attempt would be in vain. If the
inclination is not given by nature, and if it is not developed
by life independently of the man himself, this man cannot

create it in himself by force of will, and without this tendency nothing can be done as it ought to be done.

Conse-

quently the question about him was already decided. His
former thoughts had been spent in this very direction. But
now that he had finished his own side of the case (like an egotist, who always thinks first about himself, and about others
only when there is none of his own business left to think

about) , he was able to think for some one else ; that is, to think
about her. What can he do for her? She does not yet
understand what is going on in her ; she has not had such
experience of her heart as he has ; well, that's natural ; he is
four years older than she is ; at the beginning of youth four
years is a long time. Can't he, who is more experienced,
analyze what she is unable to analyze ? How, then, to interpret her dream ?

A supposition quickly presented itself to Lopukhóf ; the
cause of her thoughts may be found in the circumstance
which gave rise to her dream. In the motive to her dream
may lie the connection with its tenor. She said that she felt
bored because she did not go to the opera. Lopukhóf began
to examine his way and her way of living, and gradually everything appeared before him in its true light. The larger part
of the time not occupied by her duties she used to spend, as
he did, in solitude. Then a change began ; she began to be
always ready for amusement. Now once more their old way
had been re-established. She cannot accept indifferently this
renewal of their old mode of life ; it was not in her nature,

just as it would not be in the nature of the great majority of
people. There is nothing mysterious about it. And from
this it was a very short step to the supposition that the
explanation of everything was her close, relationship to
Kirsánof and then Kirsánof's estrangement. Why does
Kirsánof stay away? The reason seemed sufficient in itself :
his lack of time and multiplicity of occupations. But an
honest and intellectual man, who has had experience in life ,

and who is particularly able to put in practice the theory of
which Lopukhóf was an advocate, it is impossible to deceive
by any tricks or cunningness. He may be deceived through
lack of attention ; he may not pay any attention to the fact
itself ; thus Lopukhóf was deceived the first time when Kir


======================================================================

245

sánof deserted them ; at that time, to tell the plain truth,
there was no reason and consequently no desire energetically
to investigate the reason why Kirsánof became estranged.
The only important thing for him was to see whether he were
not the cause for the severance of the friendship ; it was

plain that he was not, and so there was no cause for thinking
of anything else ; he was not Kirsánof's uncle and not his
pedagogue, bound to lead in the paths of virtue the steps of
aman who understands things as clearly as he does. Yes ,
and what necessity is there in reality for him to do so ? Was
there in his relations with Kirsánof anything particularly
important for him ? As long as you are friendly and you
want me to like you, I am very willing ; no, on the contrary,
I am very sorry, but go wherever you please. Isn't it all the
same to me ? Whether there is one stupid fellow, more or
less , in the world makes no difference to me. I took the

stupid fellow to be a fine man ; I am sorry, and that's all. If
our interests are not connected with the actions of a person,

his actions in reality interest us but little, if we are serious
people , except in two cases , which, however, seem exceptions

to the general rule only for those people who are accustomed
to understand the word " interest " in the too narrow sense

of every day's interpretation.

The first case is where these

actions are interesting for us from a theoretical standpoint,
as psychological phenomena explaining the nature of a person, that is, if they have in them an intellectual interest : the
other case is where the fate of a person depends upon us .
Here we should be to blame in our own eyes for inattention

to his actions ; that is, if we take a conscientious interest in
them. But in those former stupid actions of Kirsánof there
was nothing that would not be known to Lopukhóf as a very

ordinary peculiarity among people of the present day. There
was nothing rare in a person having gentlemanly instincts
giving himself over to triviality, resulting from the present
state of things. And that Lopukhóf was destined to play
an important part in Kirsánof's fate was beyond Lopukhóf's
power of imagination. Why should Kirsánof be in need of
his interference ? Consequently, " Go ahead, my friend ! go
wherever you please without regarding me. What need
have I of troubling about you ? "
But now it is different. Kirsánof's actions suddenly seem
to have an important bearing on the interests of a woman
whom Lopukhóf loved. He could not refrain from thinking


======================================================================

246

A VITAL QUESTION.

carefully about them. But to think carefully about a fact
and understand its causes is almost one and the same thing

for a person of such a turn of mind as Lopukhóť. Lopukhóf found that his theory affords unerring means for analyzing the motions of the human heart, and I confess I agree
with him in this respect. In those long years since I have
accepted it as true, it has never once led me into error, and
it has never refused to reveal the truth to me, no matter how

deep the truth, in regard to some human action, might have
been hidden.

It is also true that the theory itself is not

easily acquired ; it is necessary to have lived and thought to
be able to understand it.

Half an hour's thinking was sufficient for Lopukhóf to
understand the relations of Kirsánof to Viéra Pavlovna .

But still he sat long thinking about the same thing ; further
explanation was needless, but it was interesting ; the discovery was made with complete fulness of details, but it was so
interesting that long he refrained from going to sleep.
However, what is the good of straining your nerves with
sleeplessness ? It is already three o'clock. " If I can't fall
asleep, I shall have to take morphine." He took two pills .
" I will just look at Viérotcha once more."

But instead of

walking over to her and looking at her, he removed his chair
over to her sofa, took her hand and kissed it .

" Milenki, you have been working too hard, and all for
my sake ; how kind you are, and how I love you ! " said she,
half asleep. No shipwreck of the spirit can resist morphine
in sufficient quantity ; at this time, two pills proved to be
enough ; he is overcome by sleep. Consequently, the shipwreck of the soul by itself is approximately equal, according
to Lopukhóf's materialistic views, to four glasses of strong
coffee, to overcome, which one pill would not have been
enough in Lupukhóf's case ; but three pills would have been
too much. He fell asleep laughing at this comparison.
XXII .
A THEORETICAL CONVERSATION .

On the following day, Kirsánof had just thrown himself
down like a sybarite, with a cigar, intending to read and rest
after his late dinner upon returning from the hospital, when
Lopukhóf came in .


======================================================================

A VITAL QUESTION.

247

" A guest at the wrong time is worse than a Tartar," said

Lopukhóf, in a jocular tone ; but his tone proved not to be
very successfully jocular. “ I disturb you, Aleksandr ; but
even if it is so, you must put up with it. I want to speak
to you seriously. I meant to have come earlier, but I overslept this morning, and I should not have found you."
Lopukhóf was now speaking without joking.
" What does it mean ? Has he really suspected? " wondered Kirsánof .

" Let us have a little talk," continued Lopukhóf, seating
himself. " Look me in the eye . "
" Yes , he is going to speak about it; there is no doubt
about it ."

" Listen , Dmitri," said Kirsánof, in a tone still more

serious . " You and I are friends ; but there are things
which even friends must not allow themselves. I beg of
you to cease this conversation. I am not inclined now to
serious conversations, and I am never ready for it." Kirsánof's eyes looked keenly and angrily, as though a
man were before him whom he suspected of committing a
murder .

" It is impossible not to speak. Aleksandr," continued
Lopukhóf, in a calm, but rather dull voice. " I have understood your manœuvres . "

" Silence ! I forbid you to speak, unless you want me to
be your enemy forever, - if you don't want to lose my
respect. "

" Some time ago, you were not afraid of losing my respect ; do you remember ? Now I understand all. I did
not understand it then ."

" Dmitri, I beg of you to leave the room, or I shall."
" You cannot leave. What do you suppose, -that I do
not have your interests at heart ? "
Kirsánof did not reply.
" My situation is a good one. Yours , judging by your
words, is not. I appear to you in the guise of a man doing
a noble deed.

But that's nonsense.

I cannot act otherwise ,

according to common sense. I beg of you, Aleksandr, to
cease your manœuvres ; they will lead to nothing."

" How ? was it really too late ? Forgive me," cried Kirsánof, impetuously ; and he could not decide whether it was
joy or grief excited in him by the words, " they will lead to
nothing."


======================================================================

248

A VITAL QUESTION.

" No ; you have not understood me.

It was not too late.

So far there has been no harm done ; we shall see whether

there will be. But now there is nothing to be seen. However, Aleksandr, I do not understand what you are speaking

about ; neither do you understand what I mean. We do
not understand each other ; isn't that so ? There is not any
need of our understanding each other, is there? These are

little enigmas which you do not understand; they are unpleasant.

There was nothing of the sort ; I have not said

anything. I have nothing to say to you. Give me a cigar ;
I forgot mine. I'm forgetful. I am going to smoke and
have a talk with you about scientific questions ; that was all
that I came for. I wanted to spend a little time in scientific talk, as I had nothing else to do. What do you think

about these strange experiments on the mechanical production of albumen ? " Lopukhóf moved from one chair to
another, so as to have a comfortable place for his feet ; he

got into an easy position, and while he smoked his cigar he
continued what he had to say. " According to my view it is

a great discovery. Have you repeated the experiments ? "
" No ; but I shall have to."

" How fortunate you are to have such a splendid laboratory at your disposal. I beg of you, try them for yourself ;
try them more carefully. A complete revolution of the whole
question of food, and of all human life - the artificial production of the principal element of nutrition, directly from
inorganic matter. It is a most extraordinary thing ; it is
equal to Newton's discovery. Don't you think so ? "

" Certainly.

Only I greatly doubt the accuracy of the

experiments . Sooner or later we shall reach this without
doubt ; science is going on in that direction, that is evident.
But now we have hardly come to it."

" Do you think so? I think so myself. Then our conversation is ended. Good by, Aleksandr. But while I say
good by, I will ask you to call on us often, just as you used
to do.

Do svidánya."

Kirsánof's eyes, which all the time had been looking
fiercely and steadily at Lopukhóf, flashed with indignation.
" It seems to me, Dmitri , that you want me to get the opinion that you have low thoughts ."
" I don't want anything of the sort. But you must come

to see us. There is nothing strange in that, is there ? You
and I are friends. What is there strange in my request ?”


======================================================================

A VITAL QUESTION.

" I cannot.

249

You are beginning a foolish piece of work,

and, therefore , wretched."

" I do not understand what you mean. And I must tell
you that whatyou say does not please me at all ; just as two
minutes ago what I said did not please you."

" I demand an explanation, Dmitri. "
" There's none to give. There is nothing, and there is
nothing to explain, and there is nothing to understand.
You are getting excited over mere nothing."
" No, I cannot let you go so." Kirsánof took Lopukhóf
by the arm as he started to leave.

" Sit down ; you began

to speak when it was not necessary. You don't realize
what you ask of me . You must hear me now to the end . "
Lopukhóť sat down .

" What right have you " -Kirsánof began in a voice of
greater indignation than before

" what right have you to

ask of me what is hard for me ? Is there anything that I
owe you ? What does this mean? It's absurd. Try to
clear your brain of romantic nonsense. Whatever you and
I regard as a normal life will come to be so, only after the
ideas of general society have entirely changed. There must
be absolute reorganization, that is true. It will be reorganized according as life is developed. Whoever gets the
new training, helps others, that is true. But until this new

education is accomplished, as long as things are not completely changed, you have no right to risk the happiness of
another. This is a horrible thing ; do you understand it, or
have you lost your senses ? ”

" No ; I do not understand anything at all, Aleksandr.
I do not know what you are talking about. You are pleased
to see a wonderful design in the simple request of a friend,
not to forget him, because he likes to see you at his house.
I don't understand why you need to get excited about it. "
" No, Dmitri ; in such talk you will not get rid of me with
a jest. I must show you that you are crazy, in thinking
about such a miserable piece of work. There are a good
many things that you and I don't acknowledge, aren't there ?
We don't acknowledge that a box on the ear carries with it
something dishonorable ; it is a stupid prejudice, a harmful prejudice, and nothing more. But have you the right
now to subject a man to the risk of getting a boxing ? That
would be on your part, a mean, low abomination, for you

would have taken away from a man the peace of his life.


======================================================================

250

A

VITAL QUESTION.

Do you understand what I mean, stupid ? Do you understand that if I love this person , and you ask me to give him
a box in the ear, which, according to my ideas and yours , is

a trifle,

do you understand that if you asked me to do

this , I should consider you a fool and a low fellow ; and if

you compelled me to do it, I should kill either you cr myself,
according to whose life were the less desirable I would
kill either you or myself, but I would not do this. Do you
understand this , you stupid fellow ? I am speaking about a
man and a slap, which is a trifle, but which takes away the
peace of life from a man.

Besides men, there are in this

world women, who are also human beings ; besides slaps,
there are other kinds of trifles , which, according to your
idea and mine, and which are really trifles, but which also
deprive people of the peace of life. Do you understand that
to subject any person, even though it be a woman, to any
such thing, which, according to your opinion and mine, and
in reality are trifles,- well, to do any such thing, it does
not matter what, -do you understand, that to subject any
one to such a thing, is mean, contemptible, dishonest ? Do
you hear me ? I say that you have dishonorable thoughts."
" My friend , you speak the exact truth about what is honorable and dishonorable ; only I do not know what you are
saying these things for, and I do not understand what relation it may have to me . I have not told you anything at all,

nor have I said anything about any intention of risking the
peace of life of anybody in the world ! nothing of the kind !
You are indulging in fancies , and that's all there is of it.

I

ask of you, my friend, not to forget me, because it is agreeable to me, as your friend, to spend time with you, and that's
all. Will you fulfil your friend's request ? "
" It is dishonorable, I told you, and I don't act dishonorablv."

" It is very praiseworthy of you that you don't ; but you
got angry over some fancy or other, and you dashed off into
theory. You apparently wanted to theorize without any reason, without any applicability to what we were talking about.
Now I also am going to theorize , also absolutely without any
direct intention, I will ask you a question that has no relation,
whatever to anything except the explanation of an abstract
truth, without any application to any one in particular. If
any one without any distaste to himself can afford to give
another pleasure, then common sense , according to my view,


======================================================================

A VITAL QUESTION.

251

demands that he give it to him, because he himself will get
pleasure from it ; isn't that so ? "

" That's nonsense, Dmitri ! You are off the point."
" I am not saying anything, Aleksandr ; I am only indulging myself in theoretical speculations .

Here is still

another : If any desire, whatsoever, is awakened for anything, does our attempt to stifle this desire ever lead to any-

thing good ? Is not that so ? No, such an attempt would
lead to no good. It leads only to the necessity increasing
threefold ; it becomes injurious or takes a false direction ;
it is both harmful and miserable, or if the desire is stifled
also, life is stifled ; that is pitiful. "

" That is not the point, Dmitri. I am going to put your
theoretical problem in another form : Has anybody a right
to subject a person to a risk, if that person's life is happy
without that risk ?

There will come a time when all the de-

mands of every man's nature will be fully satisfied, that you
and I know ; but we both know equally well that this time
has not yet come. Now a reasonable man is satisfied if he
has enough to live upon, even though parts of his nature are
not satisfied with the position in which he is satisfied to live.
I shall suppose, by the way of abstract hypothesis , that such
a fortunate man is in existence. I shall suppose that this
person is a woman ; I shall suppose again, in the way of an
abstract hypothesis, that the position in which she is satisfied
to live is married life. I will suppose that she is satisfied
with her position, and I say : given such facts according to
this abstract hypothesis. who has a right to run the risk of
destroying what is good, what she is satisfied with, in order
to try to give this person something better, which she can
easily manage to get along without. There will be a golden
age ; we know that it is coming, but it is far in the future.
The age of iron is almost gone, but the golden age has not
yet made its appearance. If according to my abstract
hypothesis , some strong demand of this person, let us sup-

pose

since it is only for an example, let us suppose, love

the necessity of love were not entirely satisfied or were ill
satisfied , I would not say anything against the danger run
by the person, but only against such danger itself, and not
against the danger brought upon him by somebody else.
And if this person finds perfect satisfaction after all for his

Now I will

say abstractly that he does not want to run the risk, and I

will say further, he is right and sensible because he does
not want to run the risk ; and I say, mean and contemptible
is the man who would subject to the risk the one who does

not want to run the risk. What can you say against this
hypothetical result ? Nothing ! Understand, then, that you
have no right."

" If I had been in your place, Aleksandr, I should have
answered in the same way ; I, like you, am speaking only in
parables ; I will imagine that you have a personal interest in
this question.

I know of course that it does not concern

any one of us ; we are speaking only as scientific men about
certain interesting sides of universal scientific principles ,
which seem to us right ; according to these views , everybody
judges about every case from his own standpoint, which is
formed by his individual relations to the thing. I only say
in this sense of the word, that if I were in your place I should
have spoken as you have, and you in my place would have
said exactly what I have said. From the general scientific
standpoint , this is an undisputable truth. A in B's place is
B ; if A were not B when in B's place, then he would not be
in B's place ; he would somehow fail to be in B's place ; isn't

it so ? Consequently you have nothing to say against this ,
just as I had nothing to say against what you said. But

according to your example I will establish my hypothesis ,
which is also abstract, and which also has no application to
anybody . Let us suppose that there are three people in existence - a supposition which contains nothing impossible ;
let us suppose that one of them has a secret which he would

like to keep from the second, and particularly from the third ;
let us suppose that the second finds out the secret of the

third, and says to him : Do as I tell you, else I shall expose
your secret to the third. What do you think about this matter? "

Kirsánof grew rather pale and for a long time twisted his
mustache .
Dmitri, you behave shamefully towards me, "
he said at last .

" Have I any special necessity upon me to act well toward
you ? what interest do I take in you ? And besides, I do not

understand what you are talking about. You and I have
been speaking as two scientific men speak among themselves .

We, without ach other various scientific hypotheses ; at last
I one without afering one which brought you to terms , and

another pleasure, thespect is satisfied. And therefore I shall

A VITAL QUESTION.

253

cease this theoretical conversation. I have a great deal of
work to do, not less than you have, and so dō svidánya. By
the way , I had almost forgotten ; Aleksandr will you fulfil my
request to come and see us ; we are good friends, you know ;
and we shall be always glad to see you. Come just as you
used to these last few months ."

Lopukhóf got up. Kirsánof was sitting, looking at his
fingers as though each one were a abstract hypothesis .
" You are acting cruelly towards me, Dmitri. I cannot help
fulfilling your request. But in my turn I shall impose one
condition ; I will come to see you ; but if I leave your
house not by myself, you must also go everywhere that I go,
and I must have no necessity of asking you. Do you hear ?
You yourself, of your own free will, without my asking you .
Without you I shall not take a step ; not to the opera, not

to call on friends or go anywhere."
" Oughtn't that condition to be offensive to me Aleksandr ?

Do you think I look upon you as a thief ?"
" I didn't speak in that sense of the word.

I would not

bring such an affront upon you as to think that you could
take me for a thief. I would give my life into your hands
without any hesitation. I hope I have a right to expect this
from you also. But what I mean is for me to know. You

do what I say, and that's all."
" Now I too know .

Yes , you have done a great deal in

this respect ; you want now to guard against this even more
solicitously. Well, in this respect you are in the right.
Yes, you have a right to compel me.

But no matter how

thankful I am to you, my friend, this will amount to nothing .
I myself tried to compel myself ; I too have a will as well
as you, and my scheme has been as clever as yours . But
whatever is done through calculation, through a feeling of
duty, by strength of will, and not by the drawing of nature,

results lifelessly. Only to kill a thing is possible through
these means, just as you have been doing with yourself, but
to make a living thing is impossible."
Lopukhóf had become sentimental over Kirsánof's words ,
" what I mean is for me to know." " Thank you, my friend.
And since we have never kissed each other, maybe we have
a desire to now ? "

If Lopukhóf had examined his actions during this conversation, as a theorist, he would have noticed with satisfac-

tion :

" How true the theory is, Egotism makes sport of

men.

Now here the most important thing he entirely sup-

pressed: ' Let us suppose that this person is satisfied with his
situation .' Now when that was said, he ought to have
replied : ' Aleksandr, your supposition is not true.' But I
held my peace because it was not to my advantage to say it.
It is pleasant for a man, as a theorist, to notice what tricks
his egotism plays with him in practical life. You are
retreating from the battle because the battle is lost for you,
but egotism turns your gestures so that you are playing the
man who is doing noble actions ."

Had Kirsánof examined his actions during this conversation, as a theorist, he would have noticed with pleasure
" How true this theory is. I wanted to preserve my own
peace, to rest upon my laurels, and here I was saying, ' You
have no right to risk a woman's peace of mind ' ; and this
be sure you yourself understand it - that I
means
actually have done a noble action to my own detriment, for
the sake of another's peace, and for your sake, my friend, and
therefore fall on your knees before the grandeur of my
soul ! It is pleasant for a man, as a theorist, to notice what
tricks his egotism plays with him in practical life. He
retreated from the battle so as not to be a fool, and gained
glory because he had accomplished a heroic action of magnanimous nobility. You did not yield to the demand at the
first word, so that you might not be troubled again about
yourself, so that you might not be deprived of the sweet
triumph in your nobility ; but egotism turns your actions
so that you are playing the man who presses forward into
-

noble endeavor . "

But neither Lopukhóf nor Kirsánof had time to examine
their actions as theorists , or to make these pleasant observations ; and the practical solution of the question seemed

to both pretty hard.
XXIII .

THE renewal of Kirsánof's frequent visits could be
explained very naturally ; five months he had been interrupted in his occupations, and he had accumulated a great
deal of work ; and so it took him a month and a half to sit
down at it, not straightening his back. Now he had finished

his neglected work, and he was more at liberty in the use of


======================================================================

A

255

VITAL QUESTION.

his time. This was so clear that there was hardly any need
of explaining it.
In fact, it was plain and all right, and did not arouse any
suspicion in Viéra Pavlovna's mind. And on the other hand,

Kirsánoť played his part with the same undoubted artistic
skill as before.

He was afraid that, when he called at the

Lopukhófs' , after his scientific conversation with his friend,
he would " lose his grip " ;¹ he would either blush from
excitement at seeing Viéra Pavlovna for the first time, or
would very noticeably avoid looking at her, or do something
of the kind. But, no, he stood firm, and he had full right
to feel satisfied from the moment that he met her ; a pleasant,

friendly smile, such as is natural in a person who is glad to
get back among old friends, from whom he had been obliged
to be absent for some time ; a calm glance, a frank and uncon-

cerned flow of speech, such as is natural to a person who has
no other thoughts in his mind, beyond those he fearlessly
speaks . If you had been the most ill-tempered, gossiping old
woman, on the lookout to find something out of the way, you
could not have found in him anything, except a man who
seems very glad that he can pleasantly kill a leisure evening in the society of his good friends .
And if the first moment was so well accomplished, what
prevented him from spending the rest of the evening just as
well ? And if he succeeded in spending the first evening so
well, then was it hard for him to spend the evenings to come
in the same way ? Not a single word which was not free
and natural, not one look which was not hearty and simple,
straightforward, and friendly, and that was all there was of it.
But if he behaved himself no worse than of old, yet the
eyes which were bent upon him were inclined to notice every
action which no other eyes would have perceived.

Yes ; no

other eyes would have seen anything. Lopukhóf himself,
whom Marya Alekséyevna acknowledged to be born for a
monopolist, was surprised at the self-possession which did
not for one moment desert Kirsánof, and as a theorist , he

derived great pleasure from such observations, contrary to the
will of those who interested him by the psychological peculiarity of this phenomenon viewed from a scientific standpoint. But the " visitor " did not prophecy in vain when she
compelled Viéra Pavlovna to read her diary. Eyes become

too sharp, when such a " visitor " whispers in your ear.
1.Oprostovolositsa : literally, become dishevelled.


======================================================================

256

A VITAL QUESTION.

But even these eyes could see nothing ; but still the " visitor" whispered, " Is it impossible to find something here, even
though there is nothing to be seen, as I myself perceive ? but
still we will try to see " ; and the eyes tried to peer, and though
they saw nothing, yet the very fact that the eyes tried to see
was sufficient for them to observe that there was something
peculiar.

Here, for instance, Viéra Pavlovna is going with her husband and Kirsánoť to their regular weekly evening, which
happens to be at the Mertsálofs'. Why doesn't Kirsánof
waltz at this unceremonious party, when even Lopukhóf
waltzes, because a general rule has been made : If you are
an old man of threescore years and ten, and have found
your way hither, then you must play the fool, together with

the others ; for here nobody looks at anybody else, everybody
has one and the same idea about it, - “ the more noise, the

more stir, the better" ; and that is equivalent to saying, the
more enjoyment for all. Then, why does not Kirsánof waltz ?
Well, he has begun to waltz ; but why did it take him several
minutes to make up his mind ? Was it worth while to spend
several minutes in thinking whether to begin or not to begin
such a very important matter ? If he had not waltzed, the
thing would have been half revealed here. If he had waltzed,
but had not waltzed with Viéra Pavlovna, the thing would
have been completely revealed here. But he was too clever
an artist in his part. He did not want to waltz with Viéra
Pavlovna, but he soon perceived that this would be noticed,
and so, after a short hesitation, which apparently bore no relation to Viéra Pavlovna or anybody else in the world, he
asked her to dance. There remained in her memory a slight,
a very slight, wonderment, which in itself she would have not
noticed, notwithstanding the whisper of the " visitor-songstress," had not the " visitor" whispered a numberless quantity of just such little, insignificant questions.
Why, for instance, after they returned from the Mertsálofs',
when they make an appointment to go to the opera, " I Puratani," on the next evening, and when Viéra Pavlovna said to
her husband, " Milenki, you don't like this opera, you will be
bored. I will go with Aleksandr Matvéitch, for he likes all
the operas ; and I believe that if you or I had written an
opera, he would like it ! " why didn't Kirsánof uphold Viéra
Pavlovna's suggestion, and say, " Really, Dmitri, I am
not going to get a ticket for you " ; why was this ? The


======================================================================

A VITAL QUESTION.

257

fact that milenki goes along also, this by itself would not have
aroused any wonderment ; for he escorts his wife everywhere,
since she had once asked him to.

" Devote more time to

me," she said. Since that time he had never forgotten it ;
consequently, there is nothing strange in his going with her :
it simply shows always one and the same thing, - that he is
kind and complaisant, that she ought to love him. That is
true ; but Kirsánof does not know this reason, and so why
doesn't he support Viéra Pavlovna in her suggestion ? Of
course these trifles are almost unnoticeable, and Viéra Pav-

lovna scarcely gives them a passing thought ; but these unnoticeable little grains of sand keep falling on the pan of the
scales, though they were almost invisible. For example, a
conversation like the following is not a little grain of sand,
but a small pebble.

On the next day, as they were going to the opera in an
izvoshchik's carriage (this was less expensive than two izvoshchiks ) , among other things they said several words about
the Mertsálofs, where they had been the evening before. They
praised their harmonious life ; they remarked that this was a
rare thing ; they all said this, including Kirsánof, who added,
" Yes , this alone is a good thing in Mertsálof, that his wife
dares tell him all the secrets of her soul."

That was all that

Kirsánof said, and each one of the three thought of saying
the same thing ; but it happened that Kirsánof alone said it.
But why did he say it ? What does it signify ? if it contained
an insinuation, what could it mean ? It would be in praise
of Lopukhóf ; it would be in favor of Viéra Pavlovna's happiness with Lopukhóf. Of course, this could have been said
with reference to no one else except the Mertsálofs ; and if it

could be supposed that he thought of the Lopukhófs together
with the Mertsálofs , then , of course, it would show that it was

directly for Viéra Pavlovna ; but what was his purpose in
saying it?

It always happens so that if a person has an inclination
to look for something, he everywhere finds what he is looking for ; even let there be not the slightest sign of it, still

he sees the sign manifestly ; let there be no shadow, but he
not only finds the shadow of what he expects to find, but the
whole substance of what he is looking for, with the most unmistakable features , and these features at every fresh thought
become more clear .

And here, besides everything else, there was really a very


======================================================================

258

A VITAL QUESTION.

substantial fact, which hid in itself a very complete solution
of the matter.

It is clear that Kirsanof respects the Lopu-

khófs ; then why did he keep aloof from them for more than

two years ? It is clear that he is a thorough gentleman ; how
did it happen that he appeared before them in the character
of a boor ? As long as Viéra Pavlovna was not called upon
to think about this, she did not think about it any more than
Lopukhóf had done ; but now she thinks about it in spite of
herself.
XXIV.

SLOWLY, unobservably, this discovery began to evolve itself
in her mind .

All the time there accumulated small, almost

undistinguishable, impressions made by Kirsánot's words and
actions , to which no one else would have given any heed,
which she herself scarcely noticed, for they were only supposed and suspected. Slowly this question, " Why did he
avoid them almost three years ?" began to interest her mind.
Slowly the idea was confirmed that such a man could not have

stayed away from any petty grounds of self-conceit, because
he is absolutely free from it. And, moreover, not knowing
why she thought of this , still more obscurely and slowly arose
from the silent depths of her life into her consciousness, the
question, " Why am I thinking about him? What is he to
me? "

And here, one time after dinner, Viéra Pavlovna was sit-

ting in her room, sewing and thinking, and she was thinking
very calmly , and she was not thinking at all of him, but of
something quite different, connected with her household, and
about the shop and about her teaching, and gradually, gradually, her thoughts were drawn to the matter concerning which,
without being conscious of it, her thoughts were more and
more often drawn. There came up recollections, little questions began to present themselves ; they multiplied, and here
they are in thousands, finding place in her thoughts ; and still
they grow and grow, and they go to form one question, the
form of which becomes clearer and clearer. " What has got
into me ? what am I thinking about ? what am I feeling ? "

and Viéra Pavlovna's fingers forget to sew, and the sewing
slips from her drooping hands. and Viéra Pavlovna grew a
shade paler, then she blushed ; she grew still paler, then the
fire touched her flushed cheeks. The next moment they were
white as snow, and with wandering eyes she ran in to her hus

band, sat herself on his knees, tremblingly threw her arms
around his neck, laid her head on his shoulder, so that it

might support her head and hide her face, and with choking
voice she said, " My dear, I love him," and she began to
weep .

" What of that, my dear? Why should you feel disturbed
about it ?"

" I do not want to offend you, my dear ; I want to love
you."

" Try. Look here : if you can, it will be well. Be calm ;
give time a chance, and you will see what you can do, and
what you cannot do. You are so dear to me ; how, then, can
you offend me ? "
He smoothed her hair, kissed her head, pressed her hand.

She could not for a long time cease her convulsive weeping ;
but gradually she became calm. But he who had for a long
time expected such a confession, was therefore able to take

it coolly.

However, even yet she could not bear to look at

his face .

" I do not want to see him ; I shall tell him to cease com-

ing to see us ," said Viéra Pavlovna.
" You must act, my love, in the way which you find will
give you the greatest happiness. And when you have become
calmer, we will talk the matter over ; for you and I, no matter what may happen between us, will always be friends,
won't we ? Give me your hand ; press mine. You see how
warmly you press it."
Every one of these phrases were spoken at long intervals,
and the intervals were filled by his smoothing her hair, fondling her, as a brother fondles a grieved sister.
" Do you remember, my dear, what you told me when we
became engaged ? You are leading me into freedom.'"
”.
Again silence and caresses. " Do you remember how you
and I talked the first time about what it means to love a

person ? It means to feel gladness at whatever is good for
that person, to feel pleasure in doing whatever may be to
his advantage. " - Again silence and caresses ،، Whatever
is for your best good gives me joy also ; but you must decide

what is best for you. Why should you be grieved? If it
brings you no misfortune, what misfortune can it bring
me?"

In these laconic words, which were repeated a good many
times, with the ordinary insignificant variations of repetition,

passed considerable time, which was equally trying for Lo-

pukhóf and Viéra Pavlovna. But while gradually getting
calmer, Viéra Pavlovna began at last to breathe more freely.
She embraced her husband tightly, and she kept repeating,
" I want to love thee, my dear, thee alone ; I want to love
no one else besides thee ."

He did not tell her that this was beyond her power ; it was
necessary to let the time pass until her strength could be
restored by calmness, giving her some sort of decision, no
matter what. Lopukhóf succeeded in writing a note for
Masha to give Kirsánof in case he should come : " Aleksandr, don't come in just now, and don't come for some time ;
there is no particular reason, and there will be no particular
reason ; it is only necessary for her to rest."
" It is necessary for her to rest ; there is no particular
reason. " A strange juxtaposition of contraries ! Kirsánof
read over the note, and told Masha that he only came to get
it, and that he had no time now to stop in ; that he had

another place to go to ; that he would stop on his way back,
after he had done the errand which the note demanded .

The evening passed peacefully according to all appearances. Half the time Viéra Pavlovna sat quietly by herself
in her room, without letting her husband stay ; the other
half of the time he sat near her, trying to calm her with the
same laconic words, and of course, not so much by his words
as by his voice, which was steady and reassuring ; of course
not with God-knows-what happiness, and of course, also,
not melancholy ; except that there was an undertone of melancholy in it, which was shown in his face. Viéra Pavlovna,
after hearing such sounds, and looking at such an expression
of face, began to think, not absolutely, but to a degree ; no,
not to a degree, but almost absolutely, that her fears had
been overestimated ; that she had mistaken for a great passion a mere imagination, which would vanish in a few days,

without leaving any trace ; or, she thought- she did think
it, only she felt that it was not so : " No, this is not so ;
no , it is so " ; or she firmly thinks that she thinks so ; and

she really thinks that it is so ; and how can she help thinking
so, while she listens to this calm, steady voice, which keeps
repeating that there is nothing to be worried about. Peacefully she fell asleep under the influence of this voice ; she

slept soundly, and she did not dream of the " visitor," and
she woke up late, and after she woke up she felt renewed
strength .
XXV .

" THE best distraction for thoughts is work," said Viéra
Pavlovna to herself, and she was entirely right. " I shall
spend every day in the shop until I am cured, and this will
help me." She began to spend the whole day in the shop.
The first day she really succeeded in greatly distracting her
thoughts ; the second day she only tired herself out, but she
could not entirely escape from them ; on the third she could
not get rid of them at all.

Thus passed a week.

The struggle was hard. Viéra Pavlovna's face grew pale,
but, by outward appearances, she was entirely calm ; she
even tried to seem happy, and in this respect she succeeded

almost without interruption. But if no one could notice
anything, and her paleness were ascribed to some slight ailment, yet Lopukhóf was not deceived ; he knew perfectly
well how it was ; he had no need to look.

" Viérotchka," he began at the end of a week, " as we
are living now, we carry out the old proverb that the cobbler has no boots, and the tailor's clothes don't fit him.

We

are teaching others to live according to our economical principles, but we, ourselves, don't take it into our heads to
arrange our own lives in accordance with them.

Isn't one

large household more advantageous than several small ones ?
I should like to apply this law to our own housekeeping
arrangements . If we had lived with somebody, we, and
those who lived with us , would have saved almost half of

our expenses. I should be able to give up those execrable
lessons , which I detest so ; my salary from the factory
would be enough, and I should get time for relaxation. I
could occupy my time with scientific work, and thus have
taken up my career again. It is only necessary to find
people such as it would be agreeable to live with. What do
you think about this ? "
Viéra Pavlovna had been looking at her husband with eyes

full of suspicion, and burning with indignation just as Kirsánof had looked at him on the day of their theoretical con-

versation. After he stopped speaking, her face was on fire.
" I beg of you to cease this conversation ; it is not becoming."


======================================================================

262

A VITAL QUESTION.

" Why so, Viérotchka? I am only speaking about pecuniary advantages ; such people as you and I, who are not
rich, must not neglect them. My work is hard, and a part
of it is even detestable to me ."

" You have no right to speak so to me."

Viéra Pavlovna

got up.

" I shall not allow you to speak to me in dark

words.

Dare to speak freely what you mean ! "

" I only want to tell you this, Viérotchka : that taking
into consideration our advantage, it would be good for us ."
" Again, silence !

Who gave you the right to be master

over me ? I shall despise you ! " She ran quickly to her
own room and locked the door .

This was their first and their last quarrel.

Till late that night Viéra Pavlovna sat with her door
locked ; then she returned to her husband's room.

" My dear,¹ I spoke to you very severe words, but do not
be angry at them. You see that I am doing my best ; instead
of helping me, you began to help along what I am struggling against, hoping, -yes, hoping - to win the victory."
" Forgive me, my love, for beginning so roughly, but now
we are reconciled, aren't we ? Let us talk reasonably."
" Oh, yes, we are reconciled, my dear. Only don't act
against me. It is hard enough, even as it is, to struggle
against myself."
" And it is useless, Viérotchka ; you have had plenty of
time to examine your feeling : you have seen that it is more
serious than you believed at first. Why torment yourself ? "

" No, my dear, I want to love you, and I do notwant to
wrong you ."
" My dear, you wish me to be happy. What ! do you
1

think that it is pleasant for me to see you keep tormenting

yourself ? "
" My dear, but you love me so ! "
" Of course I do, very dearly : there is no need of saying
that; but we both understand what love means : does it not

consist in the fact that you are happy in the happiness, that
you suffer with the suffering, of the one whom you love.
When you torment yourself, you torment me. "
" So it is , my dear; but you will suffer if I yield to this
feeling, which akh ! I cannot understand why it should
have come to me ; I curse it ! "

" It makes no difference how or why it came to you ; you
cannot help it. Now there is only one choice : either you
should suffer, and I suffer also through it, or that you cease
to suffer, and I too."

" But, my dear, I am not going to suffer; this will pass
away ; you will see this pass.
" Thank you for your efforts ;.I appreciate them, because
you show a will to fulfil what you deem your duty. But know,
Viérotchka, that it seems necessary only to you, and not to
me. I am looking upon it as a stranger ; and your position
is clearer to me than it is to yourself. I know that this wil
be useless. Struggle as long as your strength holds out, but
don't think that you are going to wrong me. For you know
how I look upon this ; you know that my view of this matter
cannot be shaken, and is founded in the nature of things :

you know all this. Can you deceive me ? Will you ever
cease to respect me? I can say further : even if your dispo .
sition towards me changed its nature, will it grow weaker ?
Isn't the contrary true ? would it not grow stronger from the
very fact that you did not find in me an enemy ? Don't pity
me ; my fate will not be in the least pitiful because you
will not be deprived of happiness on my account. But that's
enough. It is hard to say much about it, and for you to
hear is harder still. Only remember, Viérotchka, what I am
saying now. Forgive me , Viérotchka. Go to your room and
think it over, or, rather, go to sleep. Don't think about me,
but think about yourself. Only by thinking about yourself .
you may not cause me useless sorrow."
XXVI .

At the end of two weeks, while Lopukhóf was sitting
in the counting-room of his factory, Viéra Pavlovna was
spending the whole morning in extraordinary excitement.
She threw herself down on her bed, she covered her face with

her hands ; and at the end of a quarter of an hour she jumped
up, walked up and down the room, threw herself into one
chair after another, and again walked with quick, unsteady
steps , and then again threw herself on her bed , and then
walked again ; and several times she went to the writing-

desk, and stood by it, and turned away, and finally she sat

down, wrote a few words , sealed her note.

Then, in half an

hour, she seized the note, tore it up, burned it, and again she
walked about excitedly. She wrote a second letter ; this ,
also, she tore up and burned. Again she walked up and
down, and again she wrote, and hastily, scarcely stopping to
seal it ; not giving herself time to write the address, she ran
off with it to her husband's room, threw it on the table, and
hurried back to her own room, fell into a chair, and sat

motionless , hiding her face in her hands, half an hour, possibly an hour. There is the sound of the bell; it is he. She
ran into the library to seize the letter, to tear it up, to burn
it ,

but where is it ? It is not there ! where is it ?

She

hastily looked over the papers ; where is it? But Masha is
already opening the door, and Lopukhóf saw from the threshold how Viéra Pavlovna flashed out from his library into her
own room, excited and pale.

He did not follow her, but went straight into his library ;
coolly, at his leisure, he examined the table and the space
behind the table. Yes ; he had been expecting for some days

some such thing, either in the way of words or note. Nu,
here it is , a letter without address , but her seal ; nu, she must
have been looking for it, so as to destroy it, or she may have

just thrown it down. No, she must have been looking for it ;
the papers are in disorder. But how could she find it, while
in throwing it down she had been in such a flurry of excitement that, in being thrown impetuously down, like a coal
burning the hand, it slid across the whole width of the table,
and fell on the window behind the table? There is hardly
need of reading it ; the contents are what he expects. However, it is impossible not to read it.
" My dear, never was I so strongly attached to thee
as I am now. If I could only die for thy sake ! Oh, how
happy I would be to die, if it would only make thee happier !
but I cannot live without him. I wrong thee, my dear ; I
am killing thee, my dear. I do not want to do so ; I am
acting contrary to my will. Forgive me ! forgive me ! "
For quarter of an hour, maybe more, Lopukhóf stood before the table, looking attentively down at the arm of the
chair. Though it was a shock foreseen, still it was painful ;
though he had thought it all over, and decided what should be
done, and how it was necessary to act, in case such a letter

or confession came , still he could not at once collect his
thoughts . But at last he collected them. He went into the
kitchen to give an order to Masha.

" Masha, you will please not set the table until I tell you .
I am not quite well , and I must take some medicine before

dinner. But don't you wait; eat your dinner, and don't
hurry : you will have plenty of time before I shall want
mine .

I will tell when ."

From the kitchen he went to see his wife. She was lying
down, hiding her face in the pillows ; when he entered, she
shuddered : -

" You found it, you read it! bozhe moï ! how crazy I am !
It is not true- what I wrote ! it was fever ! "

" Of course, my dear ; ¹ your words must not be taken
seriously, because you were too much excited. These things
are not so easily decided. We shall have time to talk this
matter over more than once, calmly, rationally, because it is
a very important matter for us. And, meanwhile, my dear,¹
I want to tell you something about my affairs . I have succeeded in making a good many changes in them,-everything that was needed ; and I am very well content. Are
you listening ? "
‫مل‬

Of course she did not herself know whether she was lis-

tening or not ; she could only have said, however it was,
whether she heard or not, that she heard something, but she
was very far from understanding what she heard ; however,
something she did hear, and something could be drawn from
what she heard, that something was being done about something, and that it had no connection with her letter ; and

gradually she began to listen, because her mind was led to
it. Her nerves wanted to occupy themselves with something,
not with the letter ; and though it was long before she could
understand what he was driving at, yet she was reassured by
the cool and contented tone of her husband's voice, and

gradually she began to understand.
" Do listen ! because it is about a very important matter
for me. " Her husband kept repeating each question, " Do
you hear ? " - " Yes , very pleasant changes for me "-and
he begins to tell her the whole story in detail. She realizes
three-quarters of what he is telling her, - no, she knows it
all ; but it is all the same to her : " Let him speak !

How

kind he is ! " And he keeps on with his story : that he has

been tired of giving private lessons this long time, and why,
or in what family, and of what special pupils he is tired, and
how he is not tired of his occupation in the counting-room
of the factory, because it is important, and he has a great
influence over all the factory-hands, and how he has succeeded in doing something there ; how he has enabled those
who desired to learn to read and write ; how he has taught
them how to learn their letters ; how he has succeeded in get-

ting from the firm a salary for the teachers, by proving that
the workmen would in this way ruin less machinery and less
work, because in this way there would be less idleness and
drunken eyes , - of course it was a trifling salary; and how
he keeps the working people from drinking, and in order to
do this he has often been to their saloons, - and a great

deal of the same sort of talk. But the principal thing was
this , that he has made himself solid with the firm as an

active, energetic man, and he has been gradually getting the

business into his own control, so that the conclusion of his
story and the main flavor of it for Lopukhóf consisted in
this : he has accepted the place as acting manager of the
factory. The nominal manager would be an honorary person
from the firm itself, with an honorary salary, but the active
manager would be Lopukhóf himself : the member of the

firm accepted the position of nominal manager only on this
condition : " I,” says he , " cannot do it ; how can I ? " -

" You take the name then, so that an honorable man may
have it, and there will be no need for you to trouble yourself,
for I will do everything ." - " If that is the case, all right
then ; I will take the position." But the importance does
not lie in his having the power, but in the fact that he is to
have a salary of three thousand five hundred rubles - nearly

a thousand rubles more than all taken together that he had
received from his occasional hard literary work and from his
pupils and from his former place in the factory ; consequently he can give up everything now except the factory,
and that is splendid.

And all this takes more than half an

hour to relate ; and at the end of the story Viéra Pavlovna
is able to say that it is really good, and she is able to ar-

range her hair and go to dinner.
And after dinner Masha gets eight silver kopeks for an
izvoshchik , to take her in four different directions , to carry

notes from Lopukhóf, saying, " I am at leisure, gentlemen,
and I should be glad to have you come to see me." And

some time later appears the terrible Rakhmétof, and after
him, one by one, come a whole tribe of young people, and a
formidable scientific conversation begins with immeasurable
reproaches heaped up on each individual by all the rest with
all possible inconsequentialities ; but some traitors to this
lofty discussion help Viéra Pavlovna somehow or other to kill
the evening, and when half the evening is spent she guesses
where Masha has been gone so long. How kind he is ! Yes ,
this time Viéra Pavlovna had been absolutely glad on account
of her young friends, though she did not get into a gale with
them, but sat quietly, and she was ready to kiss even Rakhmétof himself .

The visitors went away towards three o'clock in the morning, and they did well in being so late. Viéra Pavlovna,
weary from the excitement of the day, had only just lain
down when her husband came in :

"While telling you about the factory, my dear Viérotchka,
I forgot to tell you one thing about my new place, and by
the way, it is not very important, and I don't know as it is
worth while to speak about it, but I will tell you some time ;

but I have one favor to ask : I want to sleep, so do you ; so
if I do not tell you the rest of the story now, we will speak
about it to-morrow ; and now I will tell you in two words.
You see when I took the place of acting manager I agreed
upon this condition : that I can take the place any time
that I want, within a month or two ; and now I want to

avail myself of this time : I have not seen my old folks in
Riazan for five years. I am going to make them a visit.
Good night,¹ Viérotchka. Don't get up. You will have time
to-morrow.

Go to sleep."
XXVII .

WHEN Viéra Pavlovna came out from her room the next

morning, her husband and Masha were already packing two
valises with things. And all the time Masha was hard at
work ; Lopukhóf gave her so many things to wrap up, and

fold, and stow away, that Masha really could not attend to
it all. " Viérotchka, you, too, come and help us." And all
three of them were drinking tea, as they were taking down
and stowing away things. Viéra Pavlovna had hardly time

to collect her wits, when her husband said, " It is half-past
eleven ; it is time to go to the station. "

" My dear, I am going with thee. "
" My love, Viérotchka, I am going to take two valises ;

there will be no room for you; you can go with Masha."
" I did not mean that ; I mean to Riazan. "

" Ah ! if that's so, then Masha may bring along the
valises , and we will go together. "
On the street you cannot well get sentimental in your
talk. And besides, there is such a rattling over the pavement. Lopukhóf could not hear all that she said ; he made
a good many replies that could not be heard, or he would not
reply at all.

" I am going with thee to Riazan," repeated Viéra Pavlovna.

" But you have not got your things ready ; how can you go ?
You can get ready if you want to ; do just as seems best
to you. But I would ask you one thing : wait till you get a
letter from me .

You will get it to-morrow ; I shall write

and mail it somewhere on my journey. To-morrow you will
get it ; wait, I beg of you."
How she throws her arms around him at the gallery of the

railway station ! With what tears she kisses him, while seeing
him into the car ! And he speaks all the time about his business in the factory ; how fine it is, and how glad his old folks

will be to see him, and how everything in the world is dross
compared with health, and how important it is for her to look
out for her health ; and just as he bids her goodby, he says,
speaking through the balustrade : " You wrote that you had
never been so fond of me as you are now ; this is true, my
dear Viérotchka. And I am not less fond of you than you
are of me .

And the disposition towards a person , - the

wishing his happiness, - this we both firmly believe in .
But there is no happiness without freedom. You would not
want to restrain me, nor I you. And if you began to use
restraint on yourself on my account, you would grieve me ;
so don't do it. Do whatever you think is for your best.
But we will see about it by and by. Write me, when you

want me to come back. Good by, my dear ; the second
bell has rung ; it's time for the train to start. Good by. "

THIS was towards the end of April. Towards the middle
of June Lopukhóf returned ; lived three weeks in Petersburg ,
then he left for Moscow, on business for the factory, as he
said. On the twenty-first of July he left ; and on the
twenty- third of July, in the morning, happened the misunderstanding in the hotel at the station of the Moscow railroad, on account of the stranger not getting up ; and two
hours later came the scene in the Kamennoi Ostrof datcha .

Now the sapient reader will not fail to have guessed who
shot himself .

" I saw long ago that it was Lopukhóf," says

the sapient reader, in triumph at his perspicacity.

Where

could he have hid himself, and how did his cap have a bullet-

hole through the top ? " There is no need of asking ; it is
only a trick of his, but he caught himself in a net, the rascal, " says the sapient reader. Nu ! God be with thee ; decide it just as thou pleasest ; there's no reasoning with
thee .
XXIX .
AN EXTRAORDINARY MAN.

THREE hours after Kirsánof left, Viéra Pavlovna came to
her senses , and almost her very first thought was , that it was

impossible to leave the shop in such a way. Yes ; though
Viéra Pavlovna loved to assure herself that the shop was

getting along by itself, yet in reality she knew that she is
only flattering herself with this thought, and, as a matter of
fact, the shop needed a director, else it would go astray.
However, the business was now very well established, and it
took but very little trouble to direct it. Mrs. Mertsálova
had two children ; but she might spare an hour, or an hour
and a half, every day, or not even every day. She surely
would not refuse, for already she has a great deal to do with
the shop. Viéra Pavlovna began to look over her things,
preparatory to the sale of them , and she herself sent Masha
first to Mrs. Mertsálova , to ask her to come, and then to the
old woman

who deals in second-hand clothes and other

things of every sort, Rachel, one of the most business-like

of Jewesses , and a very good friend of Viéra Pavlovna's,
towards whom Rachel had proved herself absolutely honest,
as almost all the small retail dealers among the Hebrews are ,

whether men or women, when they have to do with respectable people.

Rachel and Masha had to stop at their city

apartment to collect the remainder of the clothes and things ,
and on their way to stop at the furrier's , where Viéra Pavlovna's shubas were stored away for the summer, and then
to come back to their summer datcha with the whole collec-

tion, so that Rachel might put a valuation on the things, and
buy them all at once.
After Masha left the gate, she was met by Rakhmétof,
who had been prowling for half an hour around the datcha.
"Are you going away, Masha? For long ? "
" Yes ; probably I shan't get back before late this even-

ing ; I have a great deal to attend to."
" Is Viéra Pavlovna all alone by herself?"
" She is alone ."

" Then I will step in and stay with her, in your place, in
case I can do anything to help her. "
" If you only would ; and I tremble on her account.

And

I forgot entirely, Mr. Rakhmétof; call some of the neighbors. There is a cook and a nurse-girl, friends of mine, to
get dinner ; for she has not had anything to eat yet ."
" All right ! I have not had any dinner myself. We'll
help ourselves . Have you had your dinner ? "
" Yes ; Viéra Pavlovna would not let me go without it."
" Well, that's good. I imagined she would have forgotten this on account of her own trouble ."

Except Masha, and those who were her equals or superiors
in the simplicity of soul and dress, all people were rather
afraid of Rakhmétof. Lopukhóf and Kirsánof, and all those
who feared nobody and nothing, felt in his presence, at
times, some trepidation. Towards Viéra Pavlovna he was

very distant.

She found him very tiresome. He never

sought her society. But Masha liked him, though he was
less sociable and polite to her than were any other of their
visitors .

" I came without being invited, Viéra Pavlovna," he began .
" But I have seen Aleksandr Matvéitch, and I know all, and

so I came to the conclusion that I might be useful to you in
some way ; and I am going to spend the evening here."
His services might have been very useful, even now, to

help Viéra Pavlovna in undoing the things. Any one in
Rakhmétof's place would have been asked to do it , or would
have offered his services. But he did not offer, and he was

not asked. Viéra Pavlovna only pressed his hand, and, with
sincere feeling said that she was very grateful to him for his
attention .

" I shall remain in the library," he said. " If anything
is needed , call me, and if anybody comes, I will open the

door. Don't you trouble yourself."
With these words he went into the library ; took from his

pocket a big piece of ham and a hunk of black rye bread
all of which must have weighed four pounds ; he sat down
and ate it to the last crumb, striving to chew it all very fine ;

he drank half a pitcher of water ; then he went to the bookshelves and began to pick out something to read. " I know
that ; not original, not original, not original, not original."
This criticism , " not original," referred to such books as

Macaulay, Guizot, Thiers, Ranke, Gervinus.
" Ah ! but here's something good ! "
This he said, after reading on the back of several huge
tomes , " Complete works of Newton." He began hastily
to turn over the pages ; finally he found what he was looking
for, and with a lovely smile cried : " Here it is, here it is !
Observations on the Prophesies of Daniel and the Apосаlypse of St. John.¹ Yes, this side of knowledge has, till
now , remained with me without any real foundation .

Newton wrote this commentary when he was old, when he
was half sane and half crazy. It is the classical fountain
when one is on the question of the mixture of sense and
insanity. Here is a question of world-wide historical
interest ; this mixture which is in almost all occurrences , in
almost all books , and in almost all brains. But here it must

be in a model form : in the first place, the most ingenious and
normal brain that ever was known ; in the second place, the
acknowledged, undisputed insanity which was superinduced
upon this brain. And so the book is capital in its way.
The most obscure features of the general phenomenon must

appear here more distinctly than anywhere else, and no one
can have the least doubt that here you find these very
features of this phenomenon, to which the features of the
mixture of sanity and insanity are related. The book is
worth studying."

With great energy he began to read the book, which for
the last century had been scarcely read, except by those who
wanted to set it right. For any one else to read it, except
Rakhunétof, would be equivalent to eating sand or sawdust.
But it was to his taste .

Such people as Rakhmétof are rare. So far in my life
I have met with only eight examples of this species (and
that number includes two women) .

They have no inter-

relation, except in one feature. Among them were people
soft and severe, people melancholy and gay, energetic people
and phlegmatic people, sentimental people (one of them had
a severe face, sarcastic even to impudence ; another one,
with a wooden face, quiet and indifferent to everything ;
they both shed tears before me several times, like hysterical
women, and not on their own account, but during talks on
different topics. While by themselves, I am sure they wept
often) , and people who never, under any circumstances, lost
their self-possession.

There was no resemblance between

them in any respect, with the exception of the one feature,
but that feature, in itself, joined them into one species , and
separated them from the rest of humanity. I used to laugh
at those with whom I have been intimately acquainted, when
I was alone with them. They would either get angry or not,
but they would also join in the laugh. And, really, there
was so much that was amusing about them - the main
characteristic was amusing - for this very reason, that they
were people of a different species. I love to laugh at such
people .
The one whom I met in the circle of Lopukhóf and Kir-

sánof, and about whom I am going to speak here, serves as
a living proof that a reserve clause is necessary in the arguments between Lopukhóf and Mertsálof about the peculiarities of the soil in Viéra Pavlovna's second dream.

Such a

reserve clause is necessary to this effect, that no matter how

bad the soil may be, it may have some very tiny portions
which will produce healthy grain. The genealogies of the
principal characters of my narrative, Viéra Pavlovna, Kirsánof, and Lopukhóf, to tell the truth, do not go back further
than their grandfathers and grandmothers, and possibly by
some tremendous straining, you may get back still further to
some kind of great-grandmother ; the great-grandfather is
hidden by the darkness of oblivion ; all that is known of

him is probably that he was the husband of the great-grand

mother, and that his name was Kirill, because the grandfather was Kirilluitch.¹

Rakhmétof belonged to a family which has been known

since the thirteenth century ; that is, it is one of the most
ancient, not only in Russia, but anywhere in Europe.

In

the number of the Tartar prisoners, tribal chiefs who were
massacred in Tver, according to the words of the chroniclers , on account of their intention of converting the people

to Mohammedanism (an intention which they probably did
not have) , but simply out of brutality, was a certain Rakhmet. The young son of this Rakhmet by a Russian wife,
who was the niece of a nobleman of Tver - that is , the
oberhōf-marshal or field-marshal whom Rakhmet married
by force, was saved on his mother's account, and he was
baptized Mikhaïl instead of Latuif.
From this Latuif-

Mikhail Rakhmétovitch sprang a good many Rakhmétofs .
In Tver they were boyars ; in Moscow they were crownofficers ; in Petersburg, during the last century, they were
generals-in-chief ; of course not all of them: the family
branched out very widely, so that there would not have been
enough positions of general-in-chief to give them all. Our
Rakhmétof's great-great-grandfather was a friend of Ivan
Ivanovitch Shuválof's, and he put him on his feet again after
his failure, which was caused by his friendship for Muennich.
His great-grandfather was a contemporary of Rumiantsof ;
he served till he reached the rank of general-in-chief, and he
was killed at the battle near Novo. His grandfather escorted Alexander to Tilsit, and would have risen higher than
any of them, but he early ruined his career by his friendship
with Speransky. His father served without any success ,
and without any failures ; at the age of forty he resigned
with the rank of general-lieutenant, and made his home at
one of his estates which were scattered about over the sources

of the Medvyedítsa River.

The estates were, however, not

very large, all in all, probably about two thousand five hundred souls (serfs) , and during the leisure which came to him
in his country retirement, he had eight children ; our Rakh-

métof was the next to the youngest ; he had one younger

sister, and consequently our Rakhmétof did not have a large
estate ; he received about four hundred souls , and seven thou-

sand desyatins of land.

How he managed with his serfs, and

his five thousand five hundred desyatins of land is not known
to anybody, nor was it known that he kept for himself one

thousand five hundred desyatins , and, moreover, generally it
was not known, as long as he lived among us, that he was a
proprietor, or that the land retained for himself gave him
about three thousand rubles income .

This we learned after-

wards , but at that time we supposed, of course, that he was

of the same family as those Rakhmétofs, many of whom
were rich proprietors, and who, together bearing the same
name , possessed about seventy-five thousand souls around

the sources of the Medvyedítsa, Khoper, Sura, and Tsna
rivers , who forever were the district marshals

of those

places , and one or the other of them is constantly the marshal of one or the other of the governmental cities through
which run their feudatory rivers. And we knew that our friend

Rakhmétof used to spend four hundred rubles a year ; for a
student of that time that was not very bad, but for a proprietor from among the Rakhmétofs it was too little ; and so
every one of us, though we cared really very little for such
investigations, decided for himself, without making any
inquiries, that our Rakhmétof must be from some impoverished or estateless branch of the Rakhmétofs, maybe the
son of some kind of a governmental officer, who left his
children a small fortune ; but we did not bother ourselves

about these things.
Now he was twenty-two years old, and he had been a student since he was sixteen ; but for nearly three years he had
given up the University. He left the second class, went to
his estate, took charge of it, after defeating his guardian's
resistance, and winning the anathemas of his brothers, and
succeeding in making his sister's husbands forbid them to
mention his name ; then he wandered all over Russia in dif-

ferent guises , both by land and by water, and by one or the
other, in a common and an uncommon way ; for instance, by

foot, and on rafts , and in slow boats ; he had agood many
adventures, which he brought upon himself. Among other
things that he did, he sent two men to the University of

Kazan, and five to the University of Moscow ; these were
his stipendiaries ; but to Petersburg , where he, himself, in-

tended to live, he had no students at his expense, and therefore no one of us knew that, instead of four hundred, he

had three thousand rubles income. This became known only
later on, but all we knew was that he often disappeared for
some time, and two years before the time that he is sitting

in Kirsánof's library, with Newton's " Commentaries on the
Apocalypse, " he returned to Petersburg, entered the philological faculty ; before he had been in the department of
natural science, and that's all.

But if none of Rakhmétof's Petersburg acquaintances were
aware of his family and pecuniary standing , yet all who knew
him knew him by two nicknames .

One of them we have

already used in this story,-" the rigorist" ; he accepted it
with his usual easy smile of gloomy satisfaction. But when
he was called Nikitushka or Lomof, or by the full name,
Nikitushka Lomof, he smiled broadly and sweetly, and he
had just reason for it, because he was not endowed by nature,
but gained by the firmness of his will, the right to this name
which is so famous among millions of men. But it thunders
with its fame only in a district of a hundred versts in width,
running through eight provinces ; but to the readers living in

the rest of Russia it is necessary to explain what this name
meant.

Nikitushka Lomof was a river-boatman,¹ who went

up and down the Volga twenty years or fifteen years ago ; he
was a giant of herculean strength ; he was more than twentysix feet high ;

he was so broad across his chest and shoul-

ders that he weighed fifteen puds (600 pounds avoirdupois) .
Though he was such a heavy man, he was not stout. To
illustrate his strength it is necessary to give only one illustration : he used to receive the wages of four men.

When-

ever his vessel came to a city and he went to market, or, as it
is called in the Volga dialect, the bazaar, the boys' were heard
in the most distant corners of the streets , shouting : “ Here
comes Nikitushka Lomof ! here comes Nikitushka Lomof ! "

and everybody ran into the street which led from the wharf

to the bazaar, and crowds of people used to pour out after
their favorite hero .

Rakhmétof, from the age of sixteen, when he first came to
Petersburg, was, as regards strength, an ordinary lad of
1 Burlak, a rough boatman on the Volga. The name is often synonymous with
boor.

rather tall stature, rather strong, but by no means remarkable for his strength ; certainly two out of ten of his comrades

would have got the better of him. But when he was going
on to seventeen, it occurred to him that it would be a good
thing to acquire physical riches, and he began to work over
himself : he energetically practised gymnastics. This was
good ; but gymnastics only perfect the material, and it is
necessary to have a material basis ; and so for a time, which
was twice as long as he spent on his gymnastics, he used to
work every day for several hours as a common laborer, where
physical strength was required. He lugged water, he carried
wood, chopped wood, sawed trees, cut stone, dug earth, hammered iron ; he passed through a good many occupations,
and he frequently changed them, because with every new
work, with every change, some of his muscles would get a
new development.

He underwent the diet of a boxer.

He

began to nurse himself, in the full sense of the word, with the
special things which had the reputation of strengthening the
body, - beefsteaks, almost raw, more often than anything

else ; and since that time he always lived in such a way. In
a year after he began such a regime, he started off on his
wanderings , and here he had still better opportunities to develop his physical strength. He became a plowman, a carpenter, a ferryman, and a workingman - a laborer in every
kind of healthy occupation whatever. Once he went the
whole length of the Volga, from Dubovka to Ruibinsk, in the
capacity of a burlak. To tell the master of the boat and
the other burlaks that he wanted to join them would have

been regarded as absurd, and he might not have been accepted. So he simply engaged passage as a traveller, and
after making friends with the crew, he began to help tow the
boat ; and at the end of a week he put on the regular
harness, as though he had been a genuine laborer. They
quickly noticed how powerfully he was towing the boat; they
began to put his strength to the test. He out-towed three,
even four, of the strongest of his mates.

At that time he

was twenty years old, and his mates on the boat christened
him Nikitushka Lomof, after the memory of the hero, who
at this time had left the stage. In the following summer he
was travelling in a steamer. One of the second-class passengers who crowded the steamer's deck proved to be one of his
last year's co-workers on the towpath ; and in this way his
companions, who were students, learned that he must be

nicknamed Nikitushka Lomof. In fact, he acquired and,
without sparing any time, he kept up his mighty strength.
" This is necessary," he used to say ; " it gives you respect
and love among the common people.

This is useful, and it

may come handy sometime.”
This entered his mind when he was half-way through his
sixteenth year, because from that time his peculiarities began
to develop themselves. At sixteen he came to Petersburg,

as a commonplace, good-natured graduate of the gymnasium ,
a commonplace, kind, and honest youth, and he spent three
or four months in an ordinary way, as all new students do.
But he began to learn that there were among the students

some very clever heads, who had different ideas from the
rest, and he learned the names of half a dozen such students .

At that time there were only a few ; they interested him, and
he began to try to make their acquaintance.

He happened

to get acquainted with Kirsánof, and from this time dated
his regeneration into an extraordinary man, the future Niki-

tushka Lomof and the rigorist. He listened eagerly to Kirsánof the first evening . He wept ; he interrupted him with
exclamations of curses against all that was to vanish, and

blessings on all that must live. " What books shall I begin
to read ? " Kirsánof directed him. On the next day, at eight
o'clock in the morning, he was walking down the Nevsky ,
from the Admiralty to the Police Bridge, wondering which
German or French bookstore would be the first to open. He
took what he wanted, and read steadily for more than sev-

enty-two hours in succession , -from eleven o'clock on Thursday morning till nine o'clock Sunday evening,- eighty-two
hours. The first two nights he did not sleep at all. On the
third he drank eight cups of the strongest coffee ; but on the
fourth night coffee refused to support his strength. He fell
down on the floor, and slept for fifteen hours. At the end
of a week he came to Kirsánof, asked what books further he

should read, and some explanations. They became friends ;
and through him he afterwards met the Lopukhófs. In six
months, though he was only seventeen, while they were each
one and twenty, they didn't look upon him as only a young
fellow compared to themselves ; and he had indeed become an
extraordinary man .

What earnest was there in his past life for such a course ?
Not a very great one, but still there was something. His father
was a man of despotic character, very clever, educated, and

an ultra-conservative, in the very same way as Marya Alekséyevna was ultra- conservative ; but he was honest.

It was

hard for him, of course. But that would not have made any
difference to Rakhmétof. But his mother, a woman of very
delicate nature, suffered much from her husband's severity ;
and his whole life was bounded by the village. And this,
too, would not have made any difference ; there was another

thing. It happened that, when he was fifteen, he fell in love
with one of his father's mistresses .

Trouble ensued, which

was , of course, trying to her. He pitied a woman who had
suffered a great deal on his account. Thoughts began to
stir in him , and Kirsánof stood in the same relation to him

as Lopukhóf had stood to Viéra Pavlovna. There was an
earnest in his past life ; but in becoming such an extraordinary man the principal element is nature. For some time
before he left the university and went back to his estate, and
afterwards, while wandering over Russia, he adopted original
principles in his material, moral, and intellectual life ; and
after he returned, they had been crystallized into a complete
system, to which he unflinchingly adhered. He said to himself, I am not going to drink a drop of wine ; I shall not
touch a woman. " Yet his nature was passionate .
" What is the need ? There is no good of going to such ex-

tremes ." " It is necessary. We ask, demand, for all people
'the full enjoyment of life. We must bear witness with our
own lives, that we are demanding this, not for the gratification of our personal passions, not for ourselves personally,
but for humanity in general, that we speak only in accordance with principle and not from preference, according to
conviction and not individual necessity. "
Consequently, he began to lead a very severe and ascetic
style of life. To become a Nikitushka Lomof, and keep up
the character, he had to eat meat, a great deal of meat, and
he ate a great deal. But he grudged every kopek that he
spent on anything else but meat. He gave orders to his landlady¹ to buy the very best meat that was to be had, and
have the very best picces for him ; but all else that he ate
at home was of the cheapest description .

He gave up

white bread and ate only black bread at his table. For
weeks at a time he never had a piece of sugar in his mouth ;
for months at a time he never tasted fruit , or veal , or chicken.

With his own money he never bought anything of the kind.

======================================================================

" I have no right to spend money for luxuries which I can
easily get along without. " Yet he was brought up at a table
where luxury reigned, and his taste was refined, as was seen
by his remarks on dishes, when he used to dine at the table of
others. He enjoyed a good many of the dishes of which he
did not partake at his own table, but some dishes he would
not eat at the table of a stranger.

The cause for the distinc-

tion was a solid one : " What the common people eat now
and then , I, also, may eat occasionally ; but whatever is
not in the reach of the common people, I, too, must not eat.
This I must do, so as to appreciate how wretched the lives
of the people are in comparison with mine . "

Therefore, if fruits were served, he actually ate apples,
but he absolutely refused apricots ; oranges he would eat
in Petersburg, but he would not touch them in the
provinces . Don't you see, in Petersburg the people sometimes eat them, but never in the provinces . Pies he
used to eat, " because a good pirog is not worse than a
pie, and pie-crust is familiar to the common people " ; but
he never ate sardines. He used to dress very poorly, though
at one time he liked finery ; and in all other respects he led
the life of a Spartan ; for example, he never allowed a
mattress , and he slept on a bag of straw, not even allowing
it to be doubled .

He had one spot on his conscience , he did not give up
smoking . " I cannot think without a cigar. If that is really
so, then I am right ; but maybe it is from weakness of will
power." And he would not smoke båd cigars, for he was
brought up amid aristocratic surroundings. Out of his four
hundred roubles of income, he used to spend one hundred

and fifty on cigars. " It is a detestable weakness ," as he
used to express himself. And only this weakness afforded
some possibility of getting the best of him. If he went too
far with his reproaches of others, the one whom he reproached
would say to him, " Yes, but perfection is impossible - even
you smoke. "

Then Rakhmétof would break out into re-

proaches of double strength ; but the greater part he would
pour out on his own head, the other would get the smaller
share of them, though he would not be forgotten.
He succeeded in accomplishing a great deal, because in
disposing of his time he put exactly as firm restrictions on

himself as in material things. Not a quarter of an hour a
month was lost in recreation ; he did not take rest .

"My

occupations are various ; change from one occupation to
another is sufficient rest ." He did not join the circle of his
friends , whose headquarters were at Kirsánof's or the

Lopukhófs' , more frequently than was necessary to keep
him in close relations with this circle. " This is necessary ;
every-day occurrences prove the advantage of having close
connection with some circle of men ; it is necessary to have
in your power open resources for various references." With
the exception of the meetings with this circle, he never
called on anybody, except on business, and he never stayed
five minutes longer than was necessary for his business ; and
he never allowed anybody to stay with him, except on the
same conditions. Without beating around the bush he would
say to the caller, " We have talked about this business ; now
you will allow me to take up other things, because my time
is valuable ."

During the first months of his regeneration , he used to
spend almost all his time reading ; but this lasted only a
little more than six months .

When he saw that he had

acquired a systematic style of thought in the spirit whose
principles he found to be correct, he said to himself : " Reading is now a secondary matter : from this time forth I am

ready for life ; " and he began to give to reading only the
time which was free from other occupations, and such time
was very little. Notwithstanding this fact, he extended the
circle of his knowledge with wonderful rapidity ; now that
he is twenty-two years old, he is a man of remarkably solid
leaning.

This was because he had made a rule also in this

regard : luxury and pleasure there should be none ; only what
is needful. And what is needful ? He used to say : " On
every subject there are very few first-rate works ; all that
you can find fuller and clearer in these few, in all the
rest is repeated, spoiled, ruined. It is necessary to read
only them, and all other reading is only an idle waste of
time. Let us take Russian belles lettres. I say : I shall
read Gogol before anything else. In the thousand and
one other stories I see , from half a dozen lines on half a

dozen different pages, that they contain nothing else but
Gogol spoiled ; why should I read them, then ? The
same thing in science ; in science this limit is still
more striking . If I have read Adam Smith , Malthus ,
Ricardo , and Mill, I know the alpha and the omega of

their theories , and I have no need of reading hundreds of

other political economists, no matter how famous they may
be : by half a dozen lines on half a dozen pages I see that

I shall not find one single fresh thought which belongs to
them; they are all borrowed and mutilated. I read only
spontaneous works, and only to such a degree as to appreciate their spontaneity." Therefore, it was impossible to
make him read Macaulay ; after spending a quarter of an
hour on different pages, he decided : I know all the originals
from which this matter is taken. He read Thackeray's

" Vanity Fair " with delight, and he began to read Pendennis," but he gave it up when he reached the twentieth
page. " All this is said in ' Vanity Fair ' ; apparently there
will be nothing more, and so there is no need of reading it.
Every book that I read in such a way spares me the
necessity of reading hundreds of books," he used to say.¹
Gymnastics , work that served to increase his strength
and reading,
these were Rakhmétof's personal occupations ; but after he returned to. Petersburg, they took only
the fourth part of his time ; the rest of his time he spent in

helping others, or in things that did not belong to any one in
particular, constantly observing the same rule as in reading :
not to waste any time on secondary matters and with

secondary people, but to occupy himself only with things of

essential importance, from which the secondary things and
secondary people are influenced, without his interference .
For instance, outside of his circle, he used to get acquainted
only with people who had influence over others. Whoever
was not an authority for several other people could not even
begin a conversation with him ; he used to say, " I beg you
to excuse me," and go away. But in the same way it was
impossible for any one with whom he had a desire to become

acquainted to avoid him in anywise. He simply used to
come to you and say whatever he had to say, with such an
introduction as this : " I want to be acquainted with you ; it
is necessary. If you have no time now, appoint another
time. " To your trifling business he never paid the least
heed, no matter if you were his closest friend, and begged
him to help you out of your embarrassment.

" I have no

time," he would say, and go away. But in important business he used to take a share, when it was necessary, as he
expressed it, though no one may have asked his aid. ،، I

must, " he used to say. What things he used to say and do
on such occasions is beyond comprehension.

Here, for example, is my own experience with him. I
was then not very young ; I was living comfortably , and
therefore oftentimes five or six young people from my
province used to visit me. Consequently, I was a valuable
man for his purposes ; these young people were attached to
me , because they saw that I had an attachment for them ; in

this manner he heard my name. And I, when I had met
him for the first time, at Kirsánof's, had never known anything about him; this was soon after his return from his

wanderings . He came in after I did ; I was the only one in
the company whom he did not know. When he entered, he
took Kirsánof aside, and indicating me with his eyes, said
several words. Kirsánof answered him briefly, and they
separated. In a minute Rakhmétof was sitting directly in
front of me, with only a small table which stood by the sofa
dividing us , and from this distance, which was only an
arshin and a half, he began to study my face with all his
might.

I was vexed ; he examined me without any cere-

mony, as though I were not a man, but a picture : I grew
angry. It was none of his business. After looking at me
for two or three minutes , he said to me : “ Mr. N. , I

must get acquainted with you ; I know you, but you don't
know me. Ask about me of the khozyáin, and anybody else
whom you particularly trust, in this company." Having
said this, he got up and went into the other room.
" Who is that crank 1 ? "

" That is Raklımétof ; he wants you to ask whether he can
be trusted, - without hesitation ; and whether he deserves attention- he is more important than all the rest of us here

taken together," said Kirsánof, and others corroborated it.
In about five minutes he returned to the room where we

were all sitting. He did not say anything to me, and he
spoke very little to the others. The conversation was not
scientific and not important.

" Ah ! it is already ten o'clock ! " he exclaimed, after
some little time .

" At ten o'clock I have an engagement at

such and such a place. - Mr. N. ," he said, turning to me,
" I have a few words that I want to say to you. When I
took the khozydän aside to ask him who you were, I pointed
you out with my eyes, so that you must have seen that I was

asking who you were ; consequently, it would be useless not
to make signs which would be natural at asking such a

question.

When will you be at home, so that I may call on

you ? "

I did not like new acquaintances at that time, and this
imposition did not please me at all .
" I am only at home when I am asleep ; I am out all
day," I said.
" But you sleep at home ? What time do you go to bed ? ”
" Very late."
" For example ? "
" Two or three o'clock ."

" That makes no difference to me ; name your time."

" If it's absolutely necessary, I will set to-morrow, at
half-past four in the morning."
" Of course I might take your words to be insulting and
ridiculous ; but maybe it is true that you have your own
reasons , which, very likely, deserve approval. At all events ,
I shall call upon you to-morrow morning at half-past four. "
" No ; if you are so bent upon it, you may come a little

later. I will be home all the morning till twelve o'clock."
" All right ; I'll be there at ten o'clock. Will you be
alone ? "
" Yes ."

" Very good."

He came ; and without any beating around the bush, went
straight at the matter, on account of which he felt it neces-

sary to get acquainted with me. We talked for half an
hour.

What the subject was , makes no difference ; suffice it

to say, that he declared that such and such a thing must be
done. I said, " No " ; he said, " You must do it " ; I said,
" Not at all."

In half an hour he said : -

" It is evidently useless to talk about this matter longer.
Are you convinced that I am a man who deserves full
trust ? "

" Yes ; I was told so by all, and now I see for myself."
" And after all, do you still stick to your decision ? "
" I do."

" Do you know what conclusion one can draw from this ?
-that you are either a liar or a villain .”

Whatdo you think of that ? What would have been necessary to do to anybody else who said such words ? Challenge him to a duel ? But he speaks in such a tone, without

any personal feeling, like a historian, who judges coolly, and
with no intention of offending, but for the sake of truth ; and
he is so strange, that it would be ridiculous to take offence ,

and all I could do was to laugh .

" But that is one and the

same thing, " I said.

" In this case it is not one and the same thing."
" Nu, but maybe I am both at once. "
" In this case , to be both is impossible, but one of the two

things, surely : either you are thinking and acting not as you
speak, and in such a case you are a liar ; or, you are thinking and acting as you speak, in which case you must be a
villain ; one or the other must be so. I take it for granted
that it is the first hypothesis."
" Think as you please," I said, still laughing .
"Good by. At all events , understand that I still preserve my trust in you, and I will be ready to renew our conversation whenever you please."
With all the roughness of his behavior, Rakhmétof was

entirely right ; both in the very fact that he began as he did,
because he first learned thoroughly about me, and only then
undertook this business with me ; and that he ended the

conversation as he did. I really did not tell him what I
thought, and he really was right in calling me a liar ; and
this could not be offensive at all ; it was even flattering to

me, " in the present case," according to his expression ,
because there was such a case, and because he could preserve his former confidence in me, and possibly even
respect.

Yes, with all the savageness of his manners, everybody
remained satisfied that Rakhmétof acted as he did, because
it was the most simple and common-sense way of acting ;
and the terrible extremes to which he went, and his horrible

reproaches , he spoke in such a way, that no person of common
sense could be offended with them; and with all his phenomenal roughnesses, he was at heart very gentle. His
preliminary talk was always of this stamp. Every embarrassing explanation he began thus :
" You know very well that I speak without any personal
feeling. If my words prove to be disagreeable, I beg you
to excuse them ; but I find that there is no need of getting
offended when anything is kindly meant, absolutely, without
intention of offending , but from necessity.
1 Proshchaïte.

However, as

soon as it shall seem to you useless to listen to my words, I
will stop ; my rule is, to offer my opinion everywhere and
always , whenever I am impelled ; but never to impose it
upon any one ."

And actually he did not impose it ; it was impossible to
save one's self from him expressing his opinion, if he found
it necessary, but only so far that you might understand his
view of it ; but he did it in two or three words , and then he

would add : " Now you know what the tenor of my conversation would be ; do you find it useful to have such a talk ? "
If you said " No," he bowed and went off.

This was the way that he spoke and managed his affairs ,
and he had a great many things to attend to, and none of
them were matters that concerned him personally ; he had
no personal business, as everybody knew ; but what affairs
he attended to, no one in the circle knew.

It could only be

seen that he had a great deal of bother. He was at home
very little ; he was always on the go ; he was always travelling, but for the most part he walked. But there were
always people calling upon him ; either the same people, or
new ones . And on this account, he made it a rule to be
always at home between two and three ; at this time he

talked with them and had his dinner. But very often he
would not be at home for several days ; then in his place,
one of his friends who was devoted to him soul and body,
would be at his rooms and receive callers , silent as the
grave.

Two years after this glimpseof him in Kirsánof's library with
Newton's " Commentary on the Apocalypse," he left Petersburg, telling Kirsánof, and one or two of his most intimate

friends, that he had nothing more to do there, that he has
done all that he could, that he may be able to do more after
three years , that these three years are free now, that he is

thinking of availing himself of them, according as it may
seem necessary for his future activity. We learned afterwards that he left for his former estate, sold the land which he
had reserved , getting thirty-five thousand rubles for it, went to
Kazan and Moscow, gave five thousand rubles or so to his sti-

pendiaries , so that they might graduate, and that was all that
we knew about him. Where he went after leaving Moscow
is not known . After several months passed without any tidings from him, those who knew something more about him
than all the rest knew ceased to hide things , about which, by

his request, they had kept silent so long as he was among us.
Then our little circle learned that he had stipendiaries , and
also learned the larger part of his personal doings , which I have

already told. We learned a great deal about his adventures ,
which, however, did not explain everything ; in fact, explained nothing at all, but only made Rakhmétof a still more
mysterious person for the whole circle ; adventures, which,
by their strangeness, surprised us, or entirely contradicted
the opinion, which the circle entertained of him as a man

who was entirely hard-hearted as far as personal feeling
went ; one who had not, if I may use the expression, a personal heart, beating with the sensation of personal life. To
relate all of these adventures would not be in place here ; I

shall only quote two of them of two different kinds : one of
a savage order ; the other of a stamp which contradicted the

former ideas entertained by the circle in his regard. I will
select these histories from those told by Kirsánof.
About a year before he left Petersburg for the second, and

probably the last, time, Rakhmétof said to Kirsánof, “ Give
me a good quantity of plaster for curing wounds from sharp

weapons ." Kirsánof gave him a big jar, supposing that
Rakhmétof wanted to take this medicament to some society
of carpenters or other laborers, who are frequently subjected
to cuts . On the next morning, Rakhmétof's landlady came

in great alarm to Kirsánof : “ Bátiushka ! doctor, I don't
know what has happened to my tenant ; he has not been out
of his room for a long time ; he has locked the door ; I

peeked through the crack ; he was lying all in blood. I began to scream, and he says to me, says he, ' It's nothing, Agrafyéna Antonovna.' What does he mean by nothing ? Save
him bátiushka , doctor ; I'm afraid it's suicide : he is so unmerciful to himself ! "

Kirsánof ran in all haste. Raklımétof opened the door
with a melancholy broad smile ; the caller saw the thing
from which not Agrafyéna Antonovna alone might have been
frightened ; the back and shoulders of his underclothes (he
was dressed only in his underclothes) were soaked with blood ;
there was blood on the bed ; the straw bed on which he slept
was also covered with blood ; in the straw were thousands of

little nails with heads down and points up ; they penetrated
out from the bag almost an inch : 1 Rakhmétof had been

lying on them all night long.
1Half a vershók .


======================================================================

A VITAL QUESTION.

287

" For heaven's sake, what is the matter, Rakhmétof? "
cried Kirsánof, in horror .

" It is a trial ; it is necessary ; it's incredible, of course ;
however, it is necessary.

I see that I can stand it ."

Besides what Kirsánof saw, it may be judged from this
that the khozyáïka also could relate a great many interesting
things about Rakhmétof ; but in her capacity of a simplehearted and simply-dressed old woman, she was out of her
wits in regard to him, and, of course, it was impossible to
learn anything from her. This time she ran off to get Kirsánof only because Rakhmétof allowed her to do so to calm her.
She wept so bitterly, thinking that he was going to commit
suicide .

Two months after that was the end of May. Rakhmétof
was away for a week or more, but at that time nobody
noticed it, because it was a common occurrence for him to

vanish in that way. Now Kirsánof told the following story
of the way Rakhmétof spent those days. They constituted
an erotic episode in Rakhmétof's life. Love arose from an
occurrence which was worthy of Nikitushka Lomof. Rakhmétof was going from the first Pargalof into town, lost in
thoughts, and looking at the ground in his usual way. He
was near the Forestry Institute ; he was awakened from his
thoughts by the desperate shrieks of a woman ; he looked
up : a horse attached to a sharaban, in which a lady was riding, was running away. The lady, herself, was driving, but
she could not control him ; the reins were trailing on the
ground, and the horse was within two steps of Rakhmétof.
He threw himself in the midst of the way, but the horse was

already past him; he had no time to catch the reins ; he had
only time to catch the hind axle of the sharaban ; he brought
it to a stop, but it threw him down. A crowd gathered,
helped the lady out of the sharaban , and lifted Rakhmétof
to his feet. His chest was somewhat bruised, but the worst

was that the wheel had torn out a large piece of flesh from
his leg. The lady came to herself, and ordered him taken to
her datcha , which was within half a verst. He consented
because he felt weak from loss of blood, but he asked that
Kirsánof should be sent for without fail, and no other doctor.
Kirsánof found that the bruises on his chest were not serious ,

but Rakhmétof was weak from loss of blood. He lay there
for ten days . The rescued lady, of course, took care of him

herself. He could not do anything else in his weak condi

tion, and so he talked with her- all the same the time would

be wasted-he talked with her, and became quite friendly
with her.

The lady was a widow of nineteen ; she was not

poor, and, generally speaking, she was in an absolutely independent position, an intellectual and respectable woman.
Rakhmétof's fiery speeches, of course not on the subject of
love, charmed her. " I see him in my dreams surrounded by
a halo," she said to Kirsánof.

Rakhmétof also fell in love

with her. She, judging by his dress, and by everything clse,
supposed that he was a man who had absolutely nothing,
and therefore she was the first to confess her love, and she

offered to marry him, when on the eleventh day he got up
and said that he was able to go home.
" I have been more frank with you than with others . You

see, such people as I have no right to unite the fate of any one
else with their own."

" Yes, that is true," she said ; " you have no right to
marry.

But till the time when you must renounce me, love

me."

" No, I cannot accept that,” he said. " I must suppress
love in my heart ; to love you would tie my hands. Even as
it is, they cannot be free so soon, for they are already tied.
But I shall untie them ; I must not love."
What became of the lady ? A crisis must have come into
her life. In all probability she also became an extraordinary
person. I wanted to find out about it, but I cannot. Kirsánof did not tell me her name , and he himself did not know
what became of her.

Rakhmétof asked him not to see her

and not to inquire about her. " If I supposed that you knew
anything about her, I could not refrain from asking, and that
would not do ."

After hearing this story, all remembered that for a month
or two afterwards , and maybe more , Rakhmétof was more
melancholy than usual, did not get angry with himself, no
matter how his " eyes were pinched" by his low weakness , that is, for cigars, - and did not smile sweetly and broadly
when he was flattered with the name of Nikitushka Lomof.

And I recollected also more, that summer, three or four

times in conversations with me (some time after our first
conversation he began to be fond of me, because I laughed
at him) , when I was alone with him, and in reply to my rallying him, would utter such words as these : " Yes, pity me ;
you are right. I myself am not an abstract idea ; I am a

man who would like to love. Nu, it is nothing though ; it
will pass," he would add. And in reality he got over it.
Only once, after I had roused his spirits by some of my ridiculous speeches, even in the late fall, he still uttered these
words.

The sapient reader, maybe, will guess from this that I know
more about Rakhmétof than I am telling him. It may be ;
I do not dare to contradict him, because he is so sapient.

But if I do not know, there are a good many other things
that I know which thou, sapient reader, will not know, as long
as thou shalt live. But there is one thing that I really do not
know. I do not know this : where Rakhmétof is now, and

what he is doing, or whether I shall ever see him again. I
have no other information or conjectures, beyond what all
of his acquaintances have.

When three or four months had

passed since his disappearance from Moscow, and there was
no tidings at all about him, we all supposed that he went
travelling over Europe .

This conjecture apparently was true.

At least, it was confirmed by the following circumstance. In
a year after Rakhmétof disappeared, one of Kirsánof's ac-

quaintances met, on a car between Vienna and Munich, a
young Russian, who said that he had travelled all over the
Slavonic lands . Everywhere he had made friends among all
classes ; and in every country he had stayed long enough to
learn the ideas , habits, style of life, the local customs of selfgovernment, the different degrees of welfare among all the
classes of the population ; and for this purpose he had lived
in the cities and towns, and had gone on foot from one village

to another.

Then afterwards , in the same way, he had stud-

ied the Rumanians and Hungarians.

He had travelled over

Northern Germany ; from there he had again made his way
on foot to the South, in the German provinces of Austria .
Now he was going to Bavaria, and from there to Switzerland, through Wurtemberg and Baden to France, which he
intended to travel and walk through in the same way. From
there, with the same purpose in view, he was going to England ; and he intended to spend a year in this way. If any

and Italians. But if no time were left, then be it so, because this is " not so necessary " ; but the other lands are

necessary. " Why ? " " For study."
And after a year it would be " necessary" for him to be,
at all events , in the States of North America, to study, which

more " necessary " for him than any other land, and
there he was going to stay a long time ; maybe for more than
a year, and maybe forever, if he should find anything to do
there. But it was more probable that in three years he would
return to Russia, because in Russia, if not now, still by that
time, it will be " necessary " for him to be there.

was

All this seemed very much like Rakhmétof, especially
the word " necessary," which was left in the narrator's

memory. His age, his voice, his features, as far as the
narrator could remember, of the traveller, also pointed to
Rakhmétof ; but the narrator did not pay much attention at
that time to his travelling companion, who, moreover, was
not with him very long, not more than two hours. He entered the train at some little town, and he got out at some
village ; therefore the narrator could describe his appearance

only in too general terms, and there was no full certainty
possible ; but in all probability it was Rakhmétof. Yet who
can tell ? Maybe it was not he .

There was still another rumor, that a young Russian, once
a proprietor,¹ appeared before one of the greatest European
philosophers of the nineteenth century , the father of a new

philosophy, a German. " I have thirty thousand thalers ;
all I need isfive thousand. The balance I beg of you to accept from me. " (The philosopher was living very wretchedly. ) " Why ? " " To publish your works." The philosopher
naturally did not accept the offer ; but the Russian was said

to have left the money with a banker in the philosopher's
name, and to have written him thus : " Use this money as
you please.

Throw it into the river, if you want, but you

can't return it to me ; you can't find me." And it is said
that even now this money is at the banker's. If this rumor
is true, then there is no doubt that it was Rakhmétof who
appeared before the philosopher.

Such was the gentleman who was sitting in Kirsánof's
library.

Yes, this gentleman is an extraordinary man, an example
of a very rare species. I do not describe this example of a
very rare species, with all this detail, for the sake of teaching thee, O sapient reader, how to treat people of this kind
politely, for that is out of thy province. It is not likely
that thou wilt see any such people ; thy eyes, sapient reader,
are not constituted so as to see such people; they are invisible

to thee ; only honest and courageous eyes see them ; but the
description of this man will serve thee, so thou canst know
by hearsay what people there are in the world. For what
purpose this description serves my lady readers and simplehearted readers, they best know by themselves .
Yes, ridiculous people like Rakhmétof are very amusing.
I say this for their own benefit, that they are ridiculous ,
because I feel pity for them. I say to those noble people
who are fascinated by them, Don't follow their example. I
say this because the path over which they call you to follow
is barren of personal happiness. But noble people do not
listen to me . They say, " No, it is not barren, it is very
rich ; though it may be barren in some places, yet these
places are not long ; we shall have strength enough to pass
these places , and we shall come to places which are rich with

endless happiness." So thou seest, sapient reader , that it
is not for thy sake, but for the other part of the public, that
I have said that such people as Rakhmétof are ridiculous .
To thee, O sapient reader, I will declare that they are not
bad people ; otherwise, thou very likely wilt not understand
for thyself. No, they are not bad people. There are few
of them, but through them flourishes the life of all ; without
them life would become dead and putrid; there are few of
them, but they help all people to breathe ; without them
people would suffocate. The mass of honest and kind people
is great, but people like these are few ; but they are in the
midst, like theine in tea, like the bouquet in fine wine ; from
them come their strength and fragrance ; it is theflower of

the best people ; they are the motive powers of motive
powers , they are the salt of the salt of the earth.

" WELL [nu !] , " thinks the sapient reader, " now the main
character is to be Rakhmétof ; and he will put everybody
into his belt, and Viéra Pavlovna will fall in love with him ;

and soon the same story will begin with Kirsánof as happened
to Lopukhóf. "
There will be nothing of the sort, O sapient reader.

Rakhmétof will spend the evening, will speak with Viéra
Pavlovna.

easy for me to hide it from thee, and the current of my narration would not have been altered in the least if I had kept
silent ; and I tell thee in advance, that after Rakhmétof
speaks with Viéra Pavlovna, he will leave the house, and
then he will disappear forever from this narrative ; and that

he will be neither the main nor a subordinate, or any character whatsoever in my novel. Then why was he brought
into the novel at all, and described so minutely? Just try,
sapient reader, if thou canst guess why. But this will be
told thee in the following pages , immediately after Rakhmétof's conversation with Viéra Pavlovna.

As soon as he

disappears , I will tell thee at the end of the chapter. Now
just try to guess what will be said there ; it is not very hard
to guess if thou hast the least conception of the artistic, of
which thou art so fond of talking. But how canst thou ? Nu !
I will tell thee more than half of the answer.

Rakhmétof's figure, which has no influence or part in the current of this narrative ? Well (nu-ko) , guess ! The lady
reader and the simple reader, who do not talk about the
artistic, they understand. But do try to guess, thou wiseling ! For this reason plenty of time is given thee, and for
this purpose a long and thick dash is placed between the

Mrs. Mertsálova came, shed a few tears , offered some

consolation , and said it would give her pleasure to take
charge of the sewing shop, but she did not know as she had
the ability ; and again she shed a few tears and offered some
more consolation, while helping to look over the things.
Rakhmétof, after asking the servant at the next neighbor's
to go to the bakery, put up the samovar, set it on the table ,
and they began to drink their tea. Rakhinétof sat for half
an hour with the ladies, drank half a dozen glasses of tea,
and, together with them. he emptied half of a huge pitcher
of cream and ate a terrible quantity of baked things, besides

two simple loaves of white bread, which served as the foundation for the rest .

" I have a right to take this delectation, because I sacrificed twelve hours ."

He took his enjoyment, listened as the ladies tormented
themselves to death, three times expressed his opinion that
it was " nonsense " ; not the fact that the ladies were tor-

menting themselves to death, but suicide for any cause
whatsoever, except too painful and incurable physical disease, or the presentiment of some painful and unavoidable
death ; for instance, being broken upon the wheel. He
expressed this opinion in a few but strong words ; according
to his custom, he helped himself to a sixth glass of tea,
poured the remainder of the cream into it, took what was

left of the baked things, - the ladies had already long ago
finished with their tea, -bowed, and went with these ma-

terials into the library again, to enjoy the finale of his
material enjoyment, almost to make a sybarite of himself , to
place himself on the sofa, on which everybody was free to
take a nap, but which was for him something in the nature
of genuine Capuan luxury .

" I have earned my right to this delectation, because I
have sacrificed twelve or fourteen hours' time ."

After he had finished his material enjoyment, he took up
his intellectual feast again, the reading of the " Commentary

of the Apocalypse." At nine o'clock the police tchinovnik
came to tell the suicide's wife about the matter, which was

now entirely cleared up.

Rakhmétof told him that the

widow knew all about it, and there was no need of her hear-

ing anything more. The tchinovnik was very glad that he
had escaped such a tormenting scene. Then Masha and
Rachel put in appearance . They began to examine the things ;
Rachel found that everything, all told - except the good
shuba, which she advised her not to sell, because in three

months she would have to get a new one, and to this Viéra
Pavlovna consented ; that all the rest was worth four hun-

dred and fifty rubles ; and really she could not do better
than that, even according to Mrs. Mertsálova's inward con-

viction. Thus about ten o'clock, the commercial operation
was brought to an end. Rachel paid down two hundred
rubles ; she had no more ; the balance she would send in
three days to Mertsálova : so she took the things and went

off.

Mertsálova stayed for an hour longer, and then it was

time for her to go home and nurse her baby ; and she went,
saying that she would come on the next day to accompany
her to the railroad station .

After Mertsálova went away, Rakhmétof closed Newton's
" Commentary on the Apocalypse," put it carefully in its
place, and sent Masha to ask Viéra Pavlovna if he might
see her. He came in with his usual tranquillity and calmness .

" Viéra Pavlovna, I can now, to a great degree, console
you.

Now it is possible ; before it was impossible.

I will

tell you in advance that the general result of my visit will be
consoling to you ; you know that I do not speak vain words ,
therefore, and in advance, you must become calm. I am
going to lay the matter before you in due order : I told you
that I met Aleksandr Matvéitch, and that I know all about
it. This is really true ; I really saw Aleksandr Matvéitch,

and I really know everything. But I did not say that I
knew all from him, and I could not have said so, because I
do not know all from him ; because , to tell the truth, I know

all that I know, not from him, but from Dmitri Sergéitch,
who spent two hours with me.

I was told that he was com-

ing to see me, and so I stayed at home ; he was with me for
two hours , and even longer, after he had written the little
‫دو‬

note which caused you so much pain, and he asked
" You heard what he intended to do, and you did not stop
him ?"

" I asked you to be calm, because the result of my call
will be comforting to you. No ; I did not stop him, because his decision was soundly based, as you yourself will
acknowledge .

I will begin again : he asked me to spend

this evening with you, because he knew that you would be
grieved, and he gave me a message to you. He naturally
chose me to do this, because he knew me as a man who fulfils messages with minute exactness, if I undertake it ; and

cannot be turned aside by any feeling or by any requests,
from the exact fulfilment of the obligation undertaken. He
foresaw that you would implore any one to violate his will,
and he knew that I, not being moved by your prayers, would
fulfil it, and I shall fulfil it ; and so I beg of you in advance ,

do not ask me to yield in any degree from what I say.

His

commission was as follows : he, while going away, in order
‫ووو‬

to

leave these scenes 1
1 Perhaps better translated, " to leave the stage."


======================================================================

295

A VITAL QUESTION.

" Bozhe moï ! what has he done ?

How could it be that

you did not stop him ? "

" Just get the meaning of his expression, ' to leave these
scenes ,' and do not condemn me prematurely. He used that
expression in the note which you received ; didn't he ? and
we must use this very same expression, because it is very
strikingly chosen. "
Viéra Pavlovna's eyes began to show some lack of comprehension ; her whole face clearly implied the thought, " I
do not know what he means ! what am I to think about
this ?"

O Rakhmétof ! with all the apparent absurdity of his circumstantial manner of laying the matter before her, was a
master, a great master, in the art of management !

He was

a great psychologist ; he knew and could fulfil the laws of
gradual preparation .

" And so, while going away, in order, as he rightly expressed it ,

to leave these scenes,' he left in my hands a

note for you ."

Viéra Pavlovna jumped up. " Where is it? Let me have
it! and how could you sit a whole day without giving it to
me ? "

" I could , because I saw the necessity.

Very soon you

will appreciate my reasons ; they are well founded. Before
all, I want to explain to you the expression which I used
when I began, ' that the result will be comforting to you.'

Idid not mean that this note would conduce to your comfort ; for two reasons , the first of which is that the receipt of

the note would not have been sufficiently comforting to deserve the name of consolation ; isn't that true ? For conso-

lation something more is required. And so the consolation
must be in the very contents of the note."
Viéra Pavlovna again jumped up.
" Be calm ; I cannot say that you are in the wrong. Having mentioned to you the contents of the note, I shall ask

you to listen to the second reason why I could not mean by
the words comforting result ' the mere act of your receiving
the note, but that I had to mean its contents . These contents , the character of which we have insinuated , are so

important that I can only show it to you, but I cannot give
it to you. You may read it, but you cannot keep it. "
" What ! You are not going to give it to me ? "

" No ! For this very reason I was chosen ! for any one


======================================================================

296

A VITAL QUESTION.

else in my place would have given it to you. It cannot
remain in your hands, because, from the extraordinary inportance of its contents, which we have mentioned, it must

not remain in any one's hands. But you would certainly want
to keep it if I were to give it to you. Therefore, rather than
be compelled to take it away from you by main force, I shall
not give it to you, but I shall only show it to you. But I
shall only show it to you when you have sat down, put your
hands on your knees, and given me your promise not to lift
them."

If there had been any stranger there, no matter with what
a sentimental heart he had been gifted, he could not have
helped laughing over the solemnity of all this procedure,
and especially over the ceremonious ceremony of its final
scene.

It was ridiculous without doubt.

But how good it

would be for all nerves if, while imparting cruel tidings, you
were able to preserve the tenth part of the ceremony of
preparation which Rakhmétof did.

But Viéra Pavlovna, not being a stranger, of course could
only feel the trying element of this torturing slowness , and
she herself presented a figure at which the observer would
have found no less cause for amusement, when, sitting down
quickly, obediently folding her hands, and with the most
ludicrous voice, that is, with a voice of poignant impatience ,
she cried out, " I take my oath ! "

Rakhmétof laid on the table a sheet of writing paper, on
which were written ten or twelve lines .

Viéra Pavlovna had hardly cast her eyes upon them when,
at the very same instant, flushing, forgetting all her oaths,
she jumped up ; like a lightning-flash her hand grasped for
the note, but the note was already far in Rakhmétof's uplifted hand.

" I foresaw this, and therefore, if you were able to notice,
as you may have noticed, I did not take my hand entirely
from the note. The very same way I shall keep hold of this
sheet by the corner so long as it lies on the table. Therefore, all your attempts to grab it will be in vain. "

Viéra Pavlovna sat down again and folded her hands.
Again Rakhmétof put the note before her eyes .

She read

it over twenty times in excitement. Rakhmétof stood very
patiently behind her chair, keeping in his hand the corner
of the sheet. Thus passed a quarter of an hour. Finally

Viéra Pavlovna lifted her hand very quietly, evidently with

out any thieving intention, and covered her eyes with it :
" How kind ! how kind ! " she exclaimed .

" I do not entirely share your opinion, and why, we shall
see later on.

This is not the fulfilment of his commission ,

but only the expression of my opinion, which I expressed
also to him when we met last.

His commission consisted in

my showing you this note and then burning it up.
you seen it as long as you want ? "

Have

" I want to see it more , more ! "

Again she folded her hands ; again he put down the note,
and with patience as before he again stood a good quarter of
an hour. Again she hid her face in her hands, and kept
uttering , " Oh, how kind ! how kind ! "
" So far as you could learn this note by heart, you have
done so. If you were in a calm state of mind you would
not only have known it by heart, but the form of every letter
would forever be engraved in your memory, so long and attentively you have been looking at it ; but by such excitement as you are in, the laws of remembrance are violated,
and your memory may fail you. Foreseeing this emergency, I made a copy of this note ; whenever you want you
can always see this copy, which I shall retain. Sometime I
may even see the possibility of giving it to you. But now,
I suppose, the original can be burned up, and then my errand
will be ended ."

" Show it to me again ! "
Once more he laid the note down.

This time Viéra Pav-

lovna kept continually lifting her eyes from the paper : it was
evident that she was learning herself to see if she knew it
perfectly. In a few minutes she sighed and ceased to lift
her eyes from the note.

" Now, I see you have already seen it long enough. It is
already twelve o'clock, and I want to give you the benefit
of my thoughts about this affair, because I consider it useful for you to learn my opinion about it. Are you willing ? "
" Yes ."

At that very moment the note was burning in the flame of
the candle .

" Akh ! " cried Viéra Pavlovna ; " I did not mean that !
why did you ? "
" Yes , you only said that you were willing to listen to me.

But it does not make any difference now.

It was necessary

to burn it up some time. " When he had said this, Rakhmétof sat down. " And besides, there is a copy of the note
left. Now, Viéra Pavlovna, I am going to express my judg-

ment on this whole matter. I am going to begin with you.
You are going away. Why ? "
" Because it would be very hard for me to stay here. The
sight of places which would remind me of the past would
drive me crazy ! "

" Yes , it is a very disagreeable feeling. But would it be
any easier in another place ? For very few it is easy ! And
meantime, what have you done? For the sake of getting
some trifling comfort for yourself, you have left to the mercy
of chance the fate of fifty people whose lives depend upon
you. Is that good ? "
What had become of the melancholy solemnity of Rakhmétof's tone ? He spoke lively, easily, simply, enthusiastically.

" Yes ; but I was going to ask Mertsálova."
" "Tis not the same thing . You don't know whether she
would be capable of taking your place in the shop ; for her
ability in regard to this has never yet been tried. But here

a grade of ability is demanded which it is very hard to find.
There are ten chances to one that you will not find anybody
to take your place, and that your withdrawal will affect the
shop injuriously. Is that good ? You are going to subject
to certain, almost unavoidable, injury the interests of fifty

people ; and for what ? For a slight comfort to yourself. Is
that good ? What a tender solicitude for a trifling alleviation
of your pain, and what heartlessness for the fate of others !
What do you think of this part of your action ? "

" But why didn't you stop me ? "
" You would not have listened.

And then, I knew

that you would soon come back. Consequently the matter
would not amount to anything important. Do you plead
guilty ? "

" Absolutely," said Viéra Pavlovna, partly jesting, but
partly, and for the most part, in serious earnest.

"Now, this is only one part of your fault. All around
you still greater will be found. But since you confess, you
shall be rewarded by help towards correcting the other fault,
which it is possible still to correct. Are you calm now, Viéra
Pavlovna ? "

" Yes , almost. "


======================================================================

A VITAL QUESTION.

299

" All right. What do you think ? is Masha asleep ? Do
you need her now for anything ? "
" Of course not ."

" But now you are calm ; consequently , you might remember that you ought to tell her to go to bed, for it is one
o'clock, and she gets up early in the morning. Who ought
to have remembered about this, you or I ? I am going to
tell her to go to bed. And here, by the way, for your new
confession - for you are sorry for your fault now- there
shall be a new recompense.

I am going to bring whatever I

can find there for your supper. You have not had any dinner to-day, have you ? and now I think you must be hungry."
" Yes , I am ; I see that I am, now that you have reminded
me of it, " said Viéra Pavlovna, laughing heartily .
Rakhmétof brought the cold victuals which were left over

from his dinner. Masha showed him the cheese, and a jar of
mushrooms . The lunch was very excellent. He set the
table for her, and did everything himself.
" Do you see, Rakhmétof, how ravenously I am eating ?
That shows that I was hungry ; and I had not felt it before,
and I had forgotten about myself, and not about Masha alone.
So you see I am not such an ill-conditioned criminal as you
thought ."
" Neither am I such a miracle for taking care of others .

When I remembered your appetite for you, I myself wanted
something to eat; I did not have much for dinner. I suppose I ate enough to fill anybody else up to the eyes, for a
dinner and a half ; but you know how much I eat - enough
for two muzhiks ."

" Akh ! Rakhmétof, you were a good angel, and not for my
appetite alone. But why did you sit there all day, and not
show me that note ? Why did you torment me so long ? "
" The reason was a very sensible one. It was necessary
for others to see in what distress you were, so that the news
about your terrible trouble should be carried around, so as
to confirm the fact which caused you the trouble. You would
not want to make believe. Yes, and it is impossible to make
anybody's nature different from what it is ; nature acts more
vigorously. Now, there are three ways by which the fact
will be confirmed, - Masha, Mertsálova, and Rachel.

Mert-

sálova is a particularly important source. She will be enough
to take the news to all your friends. I was very glad that
you thought of sending for her. "


======================================================================

A VITAL QUESTION.

" How shrewd you are, Rakhmétof ! "
" Yes , that was not a bad thought -to wait till it was
night ; but it was not my thought. That was Dmitri Sergéitch's own idea."
" How kind he was ! "

Viéra Pavlovna sighed ; but, to tell the truth, she sighed
not from grief, but from gratefulness.
Eh ! Viéra Pavlovna, we shall yet pick him to pieces.
Lately he has thought of things very cleverly, and acted very
well. But we shall find little faults in him, and very big
ones, too."

" Don't dare to speak so about him, Rakhmétof ! I shall
get angry."
" Do you mutiny ?

There's a punishment for this .

Shall

I keep on executing you ? for the list of your crimes has only
begun."
" Execute me ! execute me, Rakhmétof ! "
" For your humility, a reward. Humility is always re-

warded. You must certainly have a bottle of wine. It will
not be bad for you to drink some .

Where shall I find it? on

the sideboard or in the cupboard ? "
" On the sideboard ."

On the sideboard he found a bottle of sherry.

Rakhmétof

compelled Viéra Pavlovna to drink two glasses, and he himself lighted a cigar.

" How sorry I am that I cannot drink three or four glasses ;
I should like it."

" Do you really like it, Rakhmétof ? "
" I envy you, Viéra Pavlovna, I envy you," said he, laughing ; " man is weak."
"Are you weak ? Thank God ! But, Rakhmétof, you surpriseme. You are not at all like what I supposed you were.
Why are you always such a gloomy monster ? But now you
are a lovely, jovial man."
" Viéra Pavlovna, I am now fulfilling a pleasant duty ; so

why should I not be happy ? But this is a rare occasion. As
a general rule, you see things about you that are not happy .
How can you help being a gloomy monster ? Only, Viéra
Pavlovna, as you happen to see me in a mood such as I would
like to be in all the time , and since there is such frankness

between us, let it be a secret that I am not by my own will a
gloomy monster. It is easier for me to fulfil my duty when
I am not noticed, because I myself would like to fulfil my

duty and still be happy in life. Now people do not try to
entertain me any more, and I do not have to waste my time
by refusing invitations. But that you may the more easily
imagine me nothing else than a gloomy monster, it will be
necessary to continue the inquisition of your crimes."
" But why do you want to find more? You have already
found two : heartlessness toward Masha and heartlessness

towards the shop ; I confess it. "

" Indifference to Masha is only a error, not a great crime.
Masha has not been lost by rubbing her sleepy eyes an hour
longer ; on the contrary, she did it with the pleasant consciousness of fulfilling her duty ; but for the shop, I really
"1

want to torture you."

" Yes, but you have already tortured me."
" Not entirely ; I want to finish it. How could you dare
to give it out at the risk of its destruction ? "
But I have confessed already that I have not given out ;

Mertsálof promised to take my place."
" We have already said that your intention of putting her
in your place was not a sufficient excuse, but by this remark

you have only pleaded guilty to a new crime. " Rakhmétof
again gradually assumed a serious, though not a gloomy,
tone. " You say that she takes your place ; is that decided ? "

" Yes, " said Viéra Pavlovna, without her former jocular
tone , anticipating that something really bad might result
from this .

" Just look here.

By whom was the matter decided ?

by you and by her, without any inquiry whether those fifty
people would consent to the change or not, or whether they
wanted somebody else, or might not find somebody else better ? This is despotism, Viéra Pavlovna. So here are two
great crimes on your part : heartlessness and despotism !
but the third one is still more cruel.

The establishment

which, to a greater or less degree, corresponded with sound
ideas of managing life, which should serve as a more or less
important corroboration of their practicability -- but practical
proofs are so few, and every one of them is so valuable

ought to be proved of real benefit to humanity. You have
afforded the upholders of darkness and wickedness an argu-

ment against your holy principles. Now I am not speaking
at all about the fact that you are going to injure the welfare
of fifty people. What does fifty people mean ? You have
injured the chances of humanity ; you have proved to be a
traitor against progress. This , Viéra Pavlovna, in the language of the Church, is called a sin against the Holy Ghost,
-a sin about which is said that any other sin may be forgiven to a person, but this, never, never. Isn't it true that
you are a criminal? But it is well that everything has ended

as it has, and that your sins were committed only in your
imagination ; but, however, you are really blushing, Viéra
Pavlovna. Good ! I will give you some consolation. If
you were not suffering so keenly, you would not have committed such horrible crimes, even in your imagination. Consequently the real criminal in things is the one who has
caused you so much trouble ; but you keep repeating, How
kind he was ! how kind he was ! "

" How do you make out that he is to blame for my suffering ?"
" Who else ? In regard to all this he has done well ; I do

not deny it ; but why did it happen ? Why all this disturbance ? Nothing of the sort should have happened ! "
" No, I oughtn't to have had this feeling, but I didn't ask
for it ; I did my best to overcome it. ”
6

" That sounds well, ought not to have had it' ! The real
cause of your sin you have not perceived ; and, for what
you are not to blame at all, you reproach yourself. This
feeling was bound infallibly to arise as soon as your nature
and Dmitri Sergéitch's came into contact ; if not one way,
then another, it would have been developed anyhow ; for the

root of the feeling does not lie in the fact that you love
another ; that is a consequence : the root of the feeling is the
dissatisfaction with your former relations. In what form
was this dissatisfaction bound to develop? If both you and

he, or either one of you, had been people of no intelligence,
not refined or even bad , it would have been developed in its
usual form

a quarrel between husband and wife. You would

have fought like cats and dogs, if both of you had been bad ;
or if one of you had been bad, one would have eaten the
other up, and the other would have been eaten. At all

events, there would have been a domestic galleys, such as

we are pleased to see almost universally in married life ;
and this , of course, would not have prevented the development of love for another ; but the main thing would be the
galleys, and the eating each other up. Your dissatisfaction
could not have taken such a form, because both of you were
enlightened people, and therefore it was developed in only
its easiest, gentlest, and least offensive form, - love towards

another.

Consequently there is no use in talking about love

to another ; that is not the main trouble at all.

The essence

of the matter lies in your dissatisfaction with your former
position , and the cause of this dissatisfaction was the discord-

ance of your characters. Both of you were good people,
but after your character became mature, Viéra Pavlovna, and
lost its childish indefiniteness , and acquired definite features ,

it proved that you and Dmitri Sergéitch were not very well
adapted to each other. Is there anything reprehensible in
either of you ? Now, for example, I also am a decent man,
but could you get along with me ? You would hang yourself with weariness of me ; how long do you suppose it
would take you to come to that point ? "

" A very few days," said Viéra Pavlovna, laughing .
" He was not such a gloomy monster as I am, yet you and
he are quite too little adapted to each other. Who ought to
have noticed it first?

ter settled sooner ?

Who was the older ?

Whose charac-

Who had the more experience in life ?

He ought to have foreseen it, and have prepared your mind so
that you would not get alarmed or worry ; but he understood

it only when the feeling, which he ought to have expected and
did not expect, was developed ; but when the feeling resulting
from the other feeling developed, then he perceived it. Why
had he not foreseen and noticed it? Was he stupid? He
had enough sense for that.

No ; it was from inattention ,

from carelessness. He neglected his duties toward you, Viéra
Pavlovna ; that is the case ; and you are declaring that he was
kind, that he loved you. " Rakhmétof, gradually becoming
excited, spoke with feeling ; but Viéra Pavlovna stopped him.
" I must not listen to you, Rakhmétof," she said, in a
tone of extreme dissatisfaction. " You are pouring reproaches upon a man to whom I am endlessly indebted."
" No , Viéra Pavlovna ; if there had been no necessity of

my saying that, I should not have said it. Did I notice it today only for the first time ? Could I have said it if I had
seen it only to-day for the first time ? You know that it is

long ago, but I held my peace. So if I speak now, it
is because it is necessary to speak. I do not say anything
before it is necessary. You saw how I kept the note ten
hours in my pocket, though it was pitiful to look at you ;
but it was necessary not to speak, and I did not speak .
Consequently , if I speak now, it shows that I thought long

ago about Dmitri Sergéitch's relations towards you ; thus ,
of course, it was necessary to speak about them.'
" No, I do not want to listen," said Viéra Pavlovna,
greatly stirred. " I ask you to be silent, Rakhmétof. I beg
of you to go. I am very much obliged to you for wasting
an evening on my account, but I beg you to leave me. "
" Are you in earnest ? "
" In earnest ."

" Very well," he said laughing. " It's all right, Viéra
Pavlovna, but you cannot get rid of me so easily ; I foresaw
that this would happen and I provided for it. The little
note which I burned up, he wrote of his own accord ; but
this he wrote according to my request ; this I can leave in
your hands because it is not a proof.

Here it is ."

Rakhmétof gave Viéra Pavlovna this note :
" Twenty-third of July; two o'clock in the morning.
Dear friend Viérotchka, listen to everything that Rakhmétof
will have to say to you. I do not know what he wants to
tell you ; I have not authorized him to say anything ; he has
not given me the least hint that he wants to speak to you ,
but I know that he never says anything but what he thinks
is necessary. Yours , D. L."
Viéra Pavlovna kissed this note, God knows how many
times.

"Why didn't you let me have it before. You probably
have something else of his ? "
" No, I have nothing more, because nothing more was
necessary. Why didn't I let you have it? Until there was
necessity, there was no need of giving it to you."
" Bozhe moi ! Why so ? For the sake of my own pleasure
in having some lines from him, now that he has gone from
me !"

" Well. if it was only for that reason, nu, that was not
very important. "

He smiled .

" Akh, Rakhmétof, you want to tease me ! "


======================================================================

A VITAL QUESTION.

305

" So this note is going to serve as another quarrel between
us, is it ? " he said, laughing again. " If that is the case, I
shall take it away from you and burn it up, for you know
that it is said about such people as you and me, that we consider nothing holy, for we are capable of all murderous

deeds of violence. But how is it ? may I continue ?"
They both grew a little more subdued ; she, on account of
having seen the note ; he, because he had been sitting a
few minutes in silence while she was kissing it.
" Yes ; I am obliged to listen."

" He did not notice that which he ought to have noticed,"
continued Rakhmétof, in a calm tone of voice, " and this
brought about bad consequences. But if he could not be
blamed for not having noticed it, still he could not be
excused for it either.

Let us suppose that he did not know

that this was bound unavoidably to arise from the very nature
of the given relations between your character and his, still
he ought, at all events, to have given you some preparation
for something of the kind, simply as a thing that might happen, which is not desirable and which it is not necessary to
expect, but which still may arise ; no one can guarantee what

occurrences the future may bring. This axiom, that there
are a good many contingencies , he certainly knew. How
did he leave you in this state of mind, that when this happened you were not prepared for it ? The very fact that he
did not foresee it resulted only from neglectfulness which was
insulting to you, but in itself is a matter of no importance ,
not abad one, not a good one. That he did not prepare you

at all for any such event came about from a very, very bad
motive. Of course he acted unconsciously, but a man's
nature is betrayed in those things which are done unconsciously. To prepare you for it would have been contradictory to his interests. But if you had been prepared, your
resistance to the feeling which was contradictory to his
interests would have been less violent. There was always
such a strong feeling in you that the most energetic resistance on your part was useless, but it is a matter of mere
chance that the feeling appealed in such a strength. If it
had been caused by a man less deserving, but still a decent
man, it would have been weaker. Such strong feelings ,
against which all struggles are useless, are rare exceptions .
Many more are the chances for the appearance of feelings
which it is possible to conquer, if the strength of the resist

ance is not weakened entirely. Now for these most likely
chances he did not want to weaken your powers of resistance. And this is the motive that he had in leaving you

unprepared and subjecting you to so much suffering. How
does this strike you ? "
" It is not true , Rakhmétof.

me any of his thoughts.

He has never hidden from

His convictions were as well known

to me as they were to you. "

Of course, Viéra Pavlovna, to hide them would have
been too much.

To interfere with the development of your

convictions, so as to gratify his own convictions, and for
this reason to make believe think differently from what he
really thinks , - this would have been an absolutely dishonorable thing. Such a manyou could never love. Did I call
him a bad man ? He was a very good man ; in what respect
was he not good ? Yes, I shall praise him to your heart's
content. I only say that before this matter arose : after
it arose, he behaved towards you very nobly ; but before it

arose, he acted unkindly towards you. Why did you torment yourself so ?

He said - and then there was no need

of saying it, because it was self-evident - that you did it, so
that you might not grieve him. How could this thought have
occurred to you, that this would greatly grieve him ? You
ought not to have had such an idea. What kind of grief
was that ? It was stupid. What kind of jealousy is that ? "
"Don't you recognize such a thing as jealousy, Rakhmétof ?"

" In an intelligent person it has no right to exist. It is a
mutilated feeling, it is a false feeling, a contemptible feeling ; it is the result of that order of things, according to
which I don't allow anybody to wear my underclothes , smoke
my meerschaum ; this is the result of viewing a person as
personal property, as a chattel."
" But, Rakhmétof, if jealousy should not be acknowledged,
then there would be a horrible state of things ."

" For him who feels it there are horrible things, but for
the one who does not feel it there is nothing horrible , or
even important. "
" But you are advocating an absolute immorality, Rakhmétof."

" Does it seem to you so, after living with him four years ?
In this respect he is to blame. How often do you dine
every day ? Once ? Would anybody be offended if you


======================================================================

A VITAL QUESTION.

307

dined twice ? Of course not. Then why don't you do so?
Is it because you are afraid of offending some one ?

In all

probability, it is simply because you do not need it, because
you do not care to. But a dinner is an agreeable thing.
But reason , and principally the stomach, says, that one dinner is agreeable and the second may be disagreeable. But

if you have a fancy or a morbid desire to dine twice a day,
would you have been kept from it by your fear of offending
somebody ? No ; if any one were offended, or forbade you
to do it, you would only do it secretly ; you would begin to
eat the dishes in a bad style, you would soil your hands by
your hurried seizing of the food, you would soil your dress
by hiding victuals in your pockets, and that's all. The
question here has nothing whatsoever to do with morality or
immorality, but only whether the contraband is a good
thing. Who has the idea that jealousy is a feeling worthy
of respect and mercy, that the feeling says , ' Akh ! when I
do this , I shall offend him ' ; and whom does it compel to

suffer vainly in the strife ? Only a few of the most noble,
for whom it is impossible to fear that their nature would
draw them into immorality. For the rest are not restrained

by this nonsense, but are simply driven to be cunning, deceitful ; that is, it makes them really bad. That is all. Is
this not well known to you ? "
" Of course it is ."

" Now, how, henceforth, can you find any moral advantage in jealousy ? "
" Yes, but we ourselves always used to speak together in
this spirit."

" Probably not absolutely in this sense of the word, or you
spoke words , but did not believe each other, when you heard
these words on each other's tongue ; and of course you really

did not believe, because you constantly heard about other
subjects , and maybe this very subject, words in a different
sense ; else why should you have suffered so long ? - God
knows how long ! And for what reason ? and from what
nonsense what a great rumpus ! How much trouble for all
three , and particularly for you, Viéra Pavlovna ! Meantime,
you all three might have lived together very calmly. just as
you did afterwards for a year ; or, somehow, you might have arranged to move into one apartment, or to have arranged it other-

wise, however it might happen, only without the least trouble.

together, and, as before, to go to the opera all three together.

Why, then, this suffering ? Why this catastrophe ? All this
because there was left in your mind, thanks to his bad method
of preparing you for it, the thought, ' I am killing him, ' which
was entirely a fancy. Yes ; he caused you entirely too much
worriment ."

" No, Rakhmétof ; you are speaking terrible things."
" Again ' terrible things ' ! Terrible to me are the awful
sufferings from trifles and unnecessary catastrophes."
" And so, then, according to your view, all our history is
a stupid melodrama."

" Yes ; an entirely unnecessary melodrama, with an entirely
unnecessary tragedy ; and for the fact that, instead of a simple conversation of the calmest tenor, arose an exciting melodrama, Dmitri Sergéitch is to blame. His honest style of
action in regard to it is hardly sufficient for covering his fault
in not averting this melodrama, by preparing you and himself
for very calm views in regard to all this, as a mere piece of
nonsense, for which it is not worth while to drink one glass
of tea more, or not to finish your glass of tea. He was very
much to blame. Nu, but he has paid dearly enough for it.
Drink one more glass of sherry, and go to bed. I have now

reached the final purpose of my call. It is already three
o'clock. If no one wakes you, you will sleep very long ; and
I told Masha not to wake you before half-past ten, so that
to-morrow you will hardly have time enough to drink your

tea ; you will have to hurry to the railroad station. If you
do not have time to put away all the things, it will not make
any difference, for you will either return soon, or they will
send them to you. What do you think is best to be done ?
Shall Aleksandr Matvéitch go after you, or will you return
by yourself ?

It would be hard for you and Masha now, for

it would not do for her to notice that you are entirely calm.
And how could she notice it during the half an hour of hasty
preparations ? Mertsálova would be a great deal worse. But
Iwill go to see her early in the morning . and tell her that she
had better not come here , because you have not slept much,

and you ought not to be wakened, but that she had better go
straight to the station. "
" How much care you take for me," said Viéra Pavlovna.
" Don't, at least, ascribe this to him ; it is of my own ac-

cord. But, except that which I reproach him for, as regards
the things of the past (to his own face I told him more things ,

turn. "At this rate, according to your opinion, then Masha,
also, is an important character, is she not ? At the very beginning of the story , she, also, brought a letter, which startled Viéra Pavlovna. And is Rachel also an important
character ? for she advanced the money, without which Viéra
Pavlovna would not have been able to leave. And is Professor

N. an important character, because he recommended Viéra
Pavlovna to Mrs. B. , without which there would not have

been any scene on returning from the Konno-Gvardéïsky
Boulevard ? Possibly the Konno-Gvardéïsky Boulevard is an
active character also .

How is it ?

Because without it there

wouldn't have been any stage for the interview while returning from it. And the Gorokhovaïa Street would certainly be
the most important main character, because without it there
would be no houses standing on it, and so Storeshnikof's

house would not be there ; consequently there would be no
manager of it, and the manager would not have any daughter,

and then there would be no story at all. Well [nu] , let us
grant that, according to your opinion, all of these are active
characters , the Konno-Gvardéïsky Boulevard, and Masha,
and Rachel , and the Gorokhovaïa Street. But only half a

half a dozen words ; but see how many pages have been given
to Rakhmétof ."

" Ah ! now I know," says the sapient reader ; “ Rakhmétof
was introduced for the sake of pronouncing the sentence on
Viéra Pavlovna and Lopukhóf.

He was necessary for the

talk with Viéra Pavlovna."

" O how dull you are, my dear sir ! You are quite wrong
in your judgment. Was it necessary to introduce an extraordinary man just for the purpose of telling his opinion
about other people ? For such necessities , maybe , your
great artists may introduce people into their works and take
them away again ; but I, though I am a wretched writer, still
somewhat better understand the conditions of the artistic .

No, my dear sir ; Rakmétof is not at all necessary for this purpose. How many times have not Viéra Pavlovna, Lopukhóf, and Kirsánof by themselves expressed the opinion about
their actions and relations ? They are not stupid people ;
they are able to judge for themselves what is good and what
is bad, and therefore for this do not need a prompter. Do
you really think that Viéra Pavlovna herself, when at leisure
after a few days , would remember the past confusion and not

condemn her forgetfulness about the interests of the shop just
as Rakhmétof had done ? And don't you think that Lopukhóf himself thought about his relations in exactly the same

way as Rakhmétof told Viéra Pavlovna? He had thought
it all over. Honorable people themselves think about themselves , all that can be said to their discredit, and so, my
dear sir , these are honorable people ; didn't you know it ?

You are very ignorant, my dear sir, in regard to what honorable people think about themselves. I shall tell you further.
Do you really suppose that Rakhmétof, in this conversation
with Viéra Pavlovna, acted independently of Lopukhóf ?
No, my dear sir ; he was only a tool for Lopukhóf, and he
himself understood that he was only Lopukhóf's tool, and
Viéra Pavlovna understood it also in a day or two, and she
would have guessed it the very moment that Rakhmétof
opened his mouth had she not been too much excited ; that

was really the state of things. Did not you really understand it ? Of course Lopukhóf, in his second note, said,
very truly, that he had not spoken a word to Rakhinétof, nor
Rakhmétof to him, in regard to the character of the conversation to take place between Viéra Pavlovna and Rakhmétof.

But Lopukhóf knew Rakhmétof very well and what Rakh


======================================================================

métof thinks about a certain matter and what Rakhmétof

would say in regard to this certain matter, for honorable
people understand each other without having any explanation beforehand. Lopukhóť might have written down beforehand almost every word that Rakhmétof was going to
say to Viéra Pavlovna, and therefore that was the very
reason that he asked Rakhmétof to be the mediator.

Shall

I not introduce you a little deeper into psychological mysteries ? Lopukhóf very well knew everything which Rakhmetóf, and he himself thought about himself, and what
Mertsálof thought, and what Mrs. Mertsálova thought, and
what the officer who wrestled with him at the picnic on the

islands thought, and what Viéra Pavlovna would come to
think about him, even if no one had told her about it.

She

would have quickly seen it as soon as the first access of
gratefulness had passed ; consequently , Lopukhóf calculated :
• I shall lose nothing by sending Rakhmétof to her, though he
will blame me ; for she herself would surely come to have
just the same opinion of me. On the contrary, I shall rise
in her estimation, for she will soon come to see that I foresaw

Rakhmétof's conversation with her, and that I arranged for
this conversation and why I arranged it, and so she will
think : " What a splendid fellow he is !

He knew that in

the first days of my excitement, my gratefulness towards
him would overwhelm me with its exaltations , and he took

care that in my mind should enter as soon as possible
thoughts which would make my trial easier for me ; and
though I was angry at Rakhmétof for his blaming him , yet

I understood that in reality Rakhmétof spoke the truth. I
myself should have come to that idea in a week; but by that
time it would not be important to me, for I should have
found peace without it, and for the reason that these

thoughts were expressed to me the very first day I got rid
of my mental burden, which I should otherwise have borne
a whole week. That day these thoughts were very important for me and useful for me. Yes , he was a very noble
man. " " "

"This was a game that Lopukhóf arranged, and Rakhmétof
was only his tool. Do you see, my dear sir ? O sapient
reader, how cunning these noble people are, and how egotism
plays with them. Not as with you, my dear sir ; because
they find satisfaction, not as you do, my dear sir. They, as
you see, find their highest satisfaction in having the people


======================================================================

A VITAL QUESTION.

whom they respect think about them as noble people, and
for this reason, my dear sir, they took trouble to play all
kinds of games, not less energetically than you do for your
own private ends ; but your aims are different, and therefore
the games that you and they bring about are not of the same
character. You think of mean things which are injurious
for others, but they think of those which are advantageous
for others ."

" Now, how do you dare to treat me in such a way ? "
exclaims the sapient reader, addressing me. " I shall bring
a lawsuit against you for this ; I shall proclaim you an
unreliable man ."

" Have mercy, my dear sir," I reply ; " I dare to tell
you such things because I have such lofty respect for your
character as well as for your brains. And I only have the
audacity to enlighten you in regard to the artistic, of which

you are so fond. You are mistaken in regard to this,
my dear sir, in supposing that Rakhmétof was introduced
purposely for announcing the sentence upon Viéra Pavlovna
and Lopukhóf. There was no such necessity in the thoughts
which you expressed about them. There is nothing of the
kind which I could not have imparted to you, my dear sir,
as the thoughts of Lopukhóf in regard to himself, and as
thoughts which, without Rakhmétof, Viéra Pavlovna herself
would have had about Lopukhóf. Now, my dear sir, here is
a question for you, Why do I relate to you this conversation between Rakhmétof and Viéra Pavlovna? Do you
understand now that if I am imparting to you, not the
thoughts of Lopukhóf and his Viéra Pavlovna, but the conversation between Rakhmétof and Viéra Pavlovna, then

why it was necessary to impart not only these thoughts ,
which constituted the essence of their conversation, but the

conversation itself ? Why was it necessary to impart to you
this conversation ?

Because it was a conversation between

Rakhmétof and Viéra Pavlovna. Do you understand now ?
Not yet ?

You're a fine fellow !

You are bad as far as

understanding goes, very bad. Nu ! I am going to chew
it for you. When two people speak, then from the conversation can be gathered, to a greater or less degree, the character of these two people. Now, do you see where this is
leading you ? Was Viéra Pavlovna's character sufficiently
known to you before this conversation took place? It was ;
you have learned nothing new about her ; you knew already


======================================================================

A VITAL QUESTION.

313

that she was hot-tempered, that she was fond of jesting,
that she never failed to eat with appetite, and could even
drink a glass of sherry ; consequently, the conversation was
not needed to characterize Viéra Pavlovna : but whom then ?

There are two who speak, she and Rakhmétof.
to characterize her ; guess, then, who is it."

It is not

" Rakhmétof
! " exclaims the sapient reader.
1

66

Well, you are a fine fellow, and I like you for it. So
you see that it is entirely contrary to what you thought before.
Rakhmétof was not introduced for the sake of carrying on

the conversation, but the conversation was imparted to you
for the sake of making you better acquainted with Rakhmétof. From this conversation you saw that Rakhmétof
would like to drink sherry, though he does not take it. That
Rakhmétof is not an absolutely gloomy monster, that, on the
contrary, on pleasant occasions, he forgets his sorrowful
humors, his burning grief, that then he jokes, and talks
gayly, although he says it is very rarely that ' I do it,' and
he says, that is bitter to me that I do it so rarely ' ; he says,
' I, myself, am not glad that I am such a gloomy monster,
but my circumstances are such that a man, with such a burning love for the good, cannot help being a gloomy monster ' ;
'And if it were not for this,' he says , ' I should probably joke,
and laugh, and sing, and leap, all day.'
" Have you understood, now, sapient reader, that although
a good many pages have been devoted to the fair description

of the sort of man that Rakhmétof was, yet, in reality, still
more pages have been devoted exclusively for the same purpose of making you acquainted with the very same person,
who is not at all an active character in my novel? Tell me
now, why this figure was brought out and introduced, and so
minutely described ? Do you remember I said then, ' It is
exclusively for satisfying the main demand of the artistic ' ?
Think ! how does it seem, and how is it satisfied by placing
before you Rakhmétof's figure ? Was it hard for you ?
Have you succeeded in finding out? and yet, how could
you ? Well, listen, or rather, don't listen ; you will not
understand it. Leave me alone ; I have amused myself
enough at your expense. I am going to speak now not to
you, but the public and I am going to speak seriously.

light. For example, if I want to draw a picture of a house,
then I must reach that excellence of drawing that it may

look to the reader as a house only, not as a little hut or as a
palace.

If I want to picture an ordinary man, then I must

be able to draw him in such a way that he will not appear
to the reader either as a dwarf or as a giant.

" I wanted to picture ordinary decent people of the rising
generation , people whom I meet by the hundreds ; I took

three such people, Viéra Pavlovna, Lopukhóf, and Kirsánof.
I look upon them as ordinary people ; they look upon themselves in the same way, and all their acquaintances and
friends, who are also such people as they are, look upon
them in the same way. Where have I spoken about them in
any other spirit? What have I said about them that contradicted this ? I introduced them with love and respect , be-

cause every honorable man is worthy of love and respect ;
but where have I bowed on my knees before them ? Where
does the least shadow of a thought show itself in my novel
that they are God-knows -how high and beautiful characters ,

that I can imagine nothing higher and better than they are ?
that they are ideals of people ? As I think of them, so they act
for me ; not more than ordinary honorable people of the rising

generation. What do they do that is wonderful ? They don't
do any mean things ; they are not cowards ; they have ordinary
honest convictions ; they try to act in accordance with them,
and that's all. What a heroism in reality ! Yes, I wanted to

represent people who act like ordinary people of their type,
and I hope that I have succeeded in so doing. Those readers who accurately know live people of this type, I hope ,
have constantly seen, from the very first, that the main
heroes of my story are not at all ideals, but are people not
at all higher than the general level of people of their own
type ; that every one of my readers who belongs to their type
has undergone two or three occurrences, in which he has
acted not worse than my characters have acted. Let us sup-

pose that other honorable people have had exactly such experiences as I have related. In this there is absolutely no
going to extremes , and the idea that all wives and husbands

should part is not presented as a charming ideal ; for not
every honorable woman feels a passionate love for her husband's best friend, and not every honorable man wrestles
with passion for a married woman, and for three years at

that ; and moreover, not everybody is driven to commit sui

cide on the bridge, or to use the words of the sapient reader,
to go away somewhere from that hotel. But no honorable
man would consider it a heroic deed to act in the situation of

those here described, exactly as they acted , but all would be
ready to do, if there were any necessity for doing it, and
many a time they have acted in situations not less, but

probably more, difficult, but still have not looked upon themselves as extraordinary people, but each has said to himself,
'I am a commonplace man, a pretty honorable man, that's
all there is of it.' And the good friends of such a man (all
such good people as he himself is - for with others he has
nothing to do in the way of friendship) also think in regard
to him that he is a fine man, but they do not think of falling
on their knees before him, but they say to themselves, We
are just such people as he is.' I hope I have succeeded in
reaching this point that every honorable man of the rising
generation will recognize an ordinary type of his good acquaintances in my three principal characters .
" But these people, who from the very first beginning of

Lopukhof, Well, now [nu da] , these are my good acquaintances, simple, ordinary people, like ourselves ' ; people who think so, I say, about my three leading characters ,
constitute the minority of the public. The majority is a
great deal lower than this type.

A man who never saw

anything but little huts, would take an ordinary house drawn
upon a piece of paper to be a palace .

How can you go to

work with such a person to show him that it is a house and
not a palace ? It is necessary on the same paper to draw at

least a small corner of a palace ; by this corner he will see
that the palace must be something of quite different proportions from the structure which was represented on the paper,

and that this structure must be only a simple, ordinary
house, in which, or even in better ones, every one ought to
live. Had I not shown Rakhmétof's figure, the majority of
my readers would have lost their senses of proportion in
regard to the main characters of my story. I will wager
that till the last part of this chapter, Viéra Pavlovna, Kir-

sánof, and Lopukhóf have seemed to the majority of the
public as heroes , as persons of the highest nature , as even

persons idealized, maybe, people such as it is not possible
to find in real life, on account of their too grand nobility .

appear to you in the right way. It is not they that stand so
high, but you that stand so low. Now you see that they are
standing on the earth. If they appear to you flying in the
clouds, it is because you are sitting in the bottom of a
den; on the height upon which they stand all people can
stand, and must. The highest natures , which you and I
cannot attain, my pitiable friends, are different. I have
shown you a slight sketch of the profile of one of them ;
you see very different features. But those people who are
completely described, you can reach unto, if you want to
work over your self-development. Whoever is lower than
they are is low. Lift yourselves up, my friends ; lift yourselves up ! It is not very hard. Go out into the free,
white world ! It is good to live in it, and the path is easy
and inviting. Try it; culture ! culture ! Observe, think,
read the works of those who tell you about the pure enjoyments of life , about the fact that a man can be kind and

happy ! Read them; they are books which fill the heart
with joy. Observe life ; for it is interesting to observe.
Think ; for it is delightful to think. That is all. No sacrifices are required ; no deprivations are asked ; they are not
necessary. Desire to be happy ! that is all; only this desire
is wanted. And for this sake with delight watch over your
development ; there is happiness in it.

Oh, what an enjoy-

ment there is for a fully developed man ! Even that which
another may look upon as a sacrifice, as a sorrow, he feels
to be a satisfaction to himself, an enjoyment ; and how open
his heart is to happiness, and how many enjoyments he has !
Try it ; it is good."

PART FOURTH.
SECOND

MARRIAGE .

I.

BERLIN, July 20, 1856.

MUCH ESTEEMED LADY, VIÉRA PAVLOVNA,
My close relationship with the late Dmitri Sergéitch
Lopukhóf gives me the hope that you will kindly include in
the number of your acquaintances a person who is an abso-

lute stranger to you, but who deeply respects you. At all
events , I venture to think that you will not accuse me of

imposing upon you. By entering into correspondence with
you , I only fulfil the desire of the late Dmitri Sergéitch, and
those tidings which I am going to impart about him you can
look upon as absolutely true, because I shall speak of his
thoughts in his own language as though he were speaking
himself. And here are his words about a matter, the explanation of which is the aim of my letter.
" The thoughts which brought the conclusion so disturb-

ing to the people nearest to me (I am quoting Dmitri Ser-

géitch's original words , as I said before] gradually grew in
my mind, and my mind was changed several times before it
received its ultimate development.

The circumstance which

caused these thoughts came under my observation in an
entirely unexpected way, only at the moment when she

[Dmitri Sergéitch means you] with fear told me about a
dream which horrified her. The dream appeared to me very
significant ; and, as a man who was accustomed to look upon
the state of her feelings from without, I understood at that
very moment that an episode was beginning in her life which,

within a longer or shorter time, would change our relations .
But a man tries till the very last to preserve the situation to

which he has become accustomed. In the depths of our
nature lies a conservative element from which we yield only
out of necessity. This , according to my opinion, contains
the explanation of my first supposition. I wanted to think,
and I succeeded in thinking, that this episode might pass
away after some time, and then our former relations would


======================================================================

318

A VITAL QUESTION.

be restored. She wanted to avoid the very episode, by kindling the warmest friendship. This deceived me, and for
several days I did not think it impossible for her hope to be
realized.

Soon I became convinced , however, that to hope

for this would be in vain. The reason for this lies in my
own character .

" I do not intend to stain my character by saying this .
This is my idea of it : " To a man who spends his life as he ought, his time is
divided into three parts, -labor, enjoyment, and rest or
recreation. Enjoyment needs rest as much as labor does .
In labor and in enjoyment, the general nature of a man
takes precedence over his other personal peculiarities ; in

work, we act under the predominating external stimulus of
rational necessities ; in enjoyment, under the predominating
stimulus of other necessities also common to the whole
human race . Rest or recreation is an element in which a

person seeks restorement of strength after this stimulus
which exhausts the reserves of life materials - an element

which is brought into life by the person himself. Here a
person wants to give himself up to his own peculiarities, to
his own individual comfort. In labor, and in enjoyment,
people are drawn to people by a general mighty power,
which is more influential than their personal peculiarities ,
by the calculation of profit in labor ; in enjoyment, by equal
demands of the organism.

Rest is different.

This is not a

thing that belongs to that general power which softens down
personal peculiarities. Rest is more of a personal thing ;
here nature demands for itself more room ; here a person
becomes more individualized, and the character of a person
shows itself from the kind of rest which appears more agreeable and more easy for him.

" In this regard people are divided into two categories. For
those of the one, rest or recreation is more agreeable than
the society of others. Everybody must have seclusion. For
them it must be an exception ; as a rule, life must be spent
with others .

This class is far more numerous than the other,

which must have the contrary.

While alone they feel much

more comfortable than in the society of others.

This differ-

ence is noticed by the common opinion, which is expressed
by the words , a social man and a reserved man.' I belong
6

to those who are not social ; she to those who are social.

That is the whole secret of our history. It is apparently


======================================================================

A VITAL QUESTION.

319

clear that in this cause there is nothing reprehensible in either
one of us ; nor is the fact reprehensible that neither one of us

had the strength to remove the cause. Against his own
nature man is weak .

" It is very hard for any one to understand the nature of
others. Every one measures the characters of everybody
else by his own peculiarities. Whatever I do not want,
according to my opinions , others will not want ; so we are
led to think by our individuality . Exceedingly noticeable
signs are required to make me realize the contrary ; and, on
the other hand , whatever affords me comfort and ease I must

think that others like. The naturalness of this arrangement
of ideas is my excuse, in the fact that I recognized too late
the difference between my nature and hers. The mistake

was greatly aided by the fact that after we came to live together, she placed me too high. There was never any equality between us ; but she showed me a great respect. My
style of life seemed to her exemplary ; she took for a universal human feature any peculiarity of mine, and for a time
she was drawn away by it. There was another cause, a
stronger one still.

"Among uncultured people the sanctity of the inner life is
but very little respected. Every one of the family, particularly
among the elders, will thrust his paw, without any ceremony,
into the very depths of your soul. The trouble is not in the
fact that your secrets are interfered with . Secrets of greater
or less importance you are careful to hide or to watch ; and

then, not all have them. A great many have absolutely
nothing to hide from nearest friends ; but every one wants
that, in his inner life, there should be a little corner where

nobody has a right to enter, just as every one wants to have
his own separate room for himself alone. Uncultured people
regard neither of these things ; if you have a separate room,
everybody goes to it, not from a desire to act the spy or to
impose upon you, but simply because there is no thought
that this may disturb you. That may occur to them only in
case there has been some disturbance between you, when you
might have no desire to see them appearing before you quite
unexpectedly . They do not understand that they may disturb you, even though you may be kindly inclined to them.
The sanctity of the threshold over which no one has a right
to step, without the permission of the person living on the
other side, is recognized only in one room ; that is the room


======================================================================

320

belonging to the head of the family, because the head of the
family can turn everybody out of his room who enters without asking permission. Into all the others, everybody who
is older or contemporary with then enters without asking.
The same which is true in regard to the room can be applied

to your inner life. Into it everybody intrudes without any
necessity, even without any thought, in search of any amusement, and, more often than not, simply to ' scratch his
tongue on your soul.'

A girl has two every-day dresses ,

one white and one pink.

She puts on the pink one ; and

here comes a chance for some one to rub tongue over her

soul.
You put on the pink dress, Aniuta; what for?' Aniuta herself does not know why she put it on. It was necessary to put on some kind of a dress ; and then, again, if she
had put on the white one, it would have amounted to the
same thing. So mámenka (or ' sister') says, ' But you
would have done better to put on the white one.' But why
it would be better, the one who gives the advice does not herself know ; she simply rubs her tongue .
You don't look
very happy to-day, Aniuta ; what's the matter ? ' Aniuta is

neither happy nor unhappy ; however, why shouldn't they
ask after what they neither see nor don't see ?

I don't

know ; there's nothing the matter that I know of.' ' No ?
you seem to be rather unhappy.' Two minutes pass. ' Aniuta, you had better sit down at the piano and play us a tune ' ;
there is no reason why. And so it goes the whole day. Your
soul is like a street, on which everybody who sits at the window is looking, not for the sake of seeing anything in particular, no, they even know that they will see nothing useful
and nothing curious,-but simply because they have nothing
else to do. But it's all the same ; so, then, why not look ?
For a street, of course it makes no difference ; but people
have no pleasure at all from people walking over them.
"Naturally, this imposition, without any aim or idea whatever, must bring a reaction ; and as soon as a person places
himself in such a situation that he can have seclusion, he for

some time finds pleasure in such seclusion, though by nature
he may be inclined to sociability and not to seclusion.

" She, in this regard till she was married, was placed in a
singularly hard position ; they walked on her ; they intruded
into her very soul, not simply because they had nothing else

to do, accidentally, occasionally, and only out of indelicacy,
but systematically, without cessation, every minute, too


======================================================================

A VITAL QUESTION.

321

coarsely, too impudently, they pushed their way in like savages, and with mean intentions, they forced themselves, not
simply with unceremonious hands, but with very hard and
very dirty hands, and therefore the reaction was very strong .

Therefore my mistake should not be severely judged.
Several months, and maybe a year, I was not mistaken ;
seclusion was really necessary and pleasant for her, and
during this time I formed an opinion about her character ;
this strong, temporary demand of hers corresponded with
my constant demand, and is it to be wondered at that I took
a temporary phenomenon for a constant feature of her char-

acter ? And everybody is so much tempted to judge of
others by his own standard ; the mistake was very great :
I do not blame myself for it, but I want to put myself

in the right light ; that means, I feel that others will not
be as indulgent to me as I am towards myself. To modify their condemnation, I must say a few words more about
that side of my character, which is entirely strange to her,
and to a good many other people, and, which without explanations , may not be rightly understood.
"My only idea of rest is seclusion. To be with others
means to occupy my mind with something, - to work or to
enjoy myself. I feel myself entirely at liberty only when I

am alone by myself. How shall I name it? Why is it?
With some it comes from reserve ; with others from bashful-

ness ; with still others from a melancholy and thoughtful disposition ; and with a fourth class from a lack of sympathy
with others ; but it seems to me that there is nothing of the

kind in me. I am frank and straightforward; I am always
ready to be gay, and I am never melancholy. To observe
people is pleasant for me, but this is connected in my mind
with the idea of work or enjoyment, and that is something
which demands rest after it ; that is , - in my way of looking
at it,
seclusion. So far as I can understand, it is a peculiar development in me, a drawing towards independence
and freedom .

" And thus the strength of the reaction against her former,
too troublesome situation in her family compelled her for a

time to adopt a style of life which did not correspond to her
constant disposition. Respect towards me kept alive in her
this temporary disposition longer than it would have been by
itself ; but I long before had formed my opinion of her
character ; I took this temporary feature to be a constant


======================================================================

one, and thus I was at ease, and that is the whole story.
On my side, it was a mistake, but there was very little
that was blameworthy in this mistake ; on her part, there

was absolutely nothing : but how much suffering did it
not cause her ! And what a catastrophe it brought upon
me !

" After her fear, caused by the terrible dream, disclosed to
me the state of her feelings, it was too late to correct my
fault ; but if I had, we had noticed it before ; then, maybe ,
by constant efforts over ourselves , she and I might have suc-

ceeded in bringing our relations into a situation forever satisfactory for us both. Could we ? I do not know, but I think
that, even if we had succeeded, it would not have been particularly advantageous. Let us suppose that we had remodelled our characters sufficiently for our relations to each
other to be free from all burdensomeness , but then the

remodelling of characters is only good when it is directed
against some bad side ; but those sides which she and I

would have had to remodel had nothing bad in them.

Why

should sociability be better or worse than a disposition to

seclusion, or vice versa ? But the remodelling of a character
is , at all events, the forcing of it, the breaking of it ; and
in the breaking of a thing there is a great deal that is lost ;
in the forcing of a thing much energy is wasted. The result which she and I, maybe , only maybe , not surely, had

reached was not worth the loss. We both would have partly
spoiled our individuality, would both have destroyed the
freshness of our lives. For what end ? Only for the sake
of preserving certain places in certain rooms. It would

have been quite a different thing if we had had children ;
it would have been necessary to think deeply as to the

323

been a great deal more, and moreover, the result would have
been far more unsatisfactory."

Such were Dmitri Sergéitch's words. From the energy
with which he expressed himself so far, you can easily see
that he, as he himself said, felt something embarrassing in
it and unprofitable to himself. He straightway added :
" I feel that I shall not be entirely justified in the opinion
of those who review this matter without any sympathy for
me ; but I am sure of her sympathy. She will judge about

me even more kindly than I myself, and I consider myself
entirely in the right. Such is my opinion of the time until
she had the dream. "

And now I am going to tell you how he felt and what he
intended to do after you had the dream which revealed to

him the unsatisfactory nature of your relations .

" I said [these again are Dmitri Sergéitch's own words]
that from the first words about her terrible dream , I understood the unavoidableness of some episode different from our

former relations. I expected it would have a mighty power,
for it was impossible otherwise, from the energy of her
nature and by the former state of her dissatisfaction, which
had already acquired great strength from a too prolonged
restraint.

Still, the expectation at first appeared in a form

very easy and profitable for me. I reasoned thus : she will
be drawn away for a time by a passionate love for somebody
else ; a year or two will pass and she will return to her old
allegiance. I am a very decent man. Her chances of finding another man like me are rare (I speak about myself just

exactly as I think ; I have no hypocritical fashion of depreciating myself) . A feeling of love satisfied will lose a portion of its force ; she will see that though one part of her

nature is less satisfied by living with me, yet in the general
sum of existence life with me will be easier and freer than
with any other, and everything will be restored to its former
state. I, taught by experience, shall be more attentive to
her.

She will acquire new respect for me ; she will be more

warmly attached to me than before, and we shall live more
happily than ever .
" But ( and this thing, though the explanation of it is very

embarrassing for me, must nevertheless be said) , but how
did the prospect of our relationship being renewed appear to
me ? Did it make me happy ? Of course it did ! But did

it bring only happiness ? No ; it appeared to me as a bur

den, a pleasant burden, but still a burden. 'I love her
very, very dearly, and I shall easily break myself in, so as
better to attend to her ; this will afford me pleasure, but still
my life will be trying.' Thus it came over me, after I regained my calmness after the first impression ; and I saw
that I was not mistaken. She allowed me to experience
this when she wanted me to act so as to preserve her love.
A month in which I satisfied this desire of hers was the

most burdensome month of my life. There was no pain in
it- such a word would hardly apply to the idea ; it would be
absurd here , as far as positive sensations are concerned.

I

experienced nothing but pleasure while pleasing her, but it
was tiresome to me. Here is where the mystery lies, that
her attempt to retain her love for me remained a failure. I
was tired while pleasing her.
"At first sight it may seem strange why I did not feel tired
ofgiving up numberless evenings to the students , for whom,
of course, I would not put myself out seriously, and why I felt
such a degree of weariness when I gave up only a few evenings to a woman whom I loved more than myself ; for whom

I would be ready not only to die, but to endure every imaginable torture. This may seem strange, but only for one who
cannot appreciate my motives in having intimate relations
with the young men to whom I devoted so much time. In
the first place, I had no personal relations with these young
people. When I was sitting with them I did not feel that I
was in the presence of people , but I saw only several abstract

types who were only exchanging thoughts. My talk with
them varied but little from my own contemplations when
alone .

Here only one part of my nature was occupied, and

the very one which less than all others demanded rest, —
thought. Everything else was sleeping ; and besides , our
talk had a practical, useful aim,- the aiding the development of intellectual life, nobility, and energy in my young
friends . This was work ; but it was such an easy work that
it was good for the restoration of strength, expended by
other kinds of labor; it did not weary, but refreshed, and
yet it was labor. Therefore my own person had no demands
for taking rest. There I expected to get benefit, but not
peace ; here I allowed all the other parts of my being to

sleep, except thought. But my thought acted without any
mixture of personal relations towards people with whom I

was speaking ; therefore I felt as much liberty as though I


======================================================================

A VITAL QUESTION.

325

had been alone. These conversations, I may say, did not
take me out of my seclusion.

Here there was nothing anal-

ogous to those relations in which the whole man takes part.
" I know how embarrassing it is to use the word ' weariness,'
4

but my conscience does not allow me to keep it back. Yes,
with all my love to her, I felt a great deal easier after I became convinced that, between her and me , relations could

not comfortably be arranged as they had been before. I
gradually became convinced of this about the time that she
began to notice that the fulfilling of this desire was going to
be tiresome to me.

Then the future appeared to me under a

new form, which was more agreeable to me. After we saw
that it would be impossible for us to remain in our former

relations, I began to think how soon it would be possible
- I must again use an embarrassing expression - to get rid
of it- to free myself from a situation which had become
burdensome to me .

Here lies the secret of what must seem

magnanimity to the man who might be willing to be blinded
by acknowledgment of the outward appearances , or even to
one who would be so shortsighted as not to see the whole
depth of the motives. Yes, I simply wanted to get rid of
an embarrassing situation. As I am not hypocritical enough
to deny what is good in me, I shall also not deny that one of
my motives was the desire for her good ; but this was only a
secondary motive, a very strong one, to be sure, yet it fell
far behind the first, the main one, in strength ; that is , the
desire of getting free from weariness was the real prompter.
Under its influence I began carefully to examine into her
mode of life, and easily perceived that in the change of her
feelings, which was the result of the change in her way of
living, the main part was played by Aleksandr Matvéitch in
his appearance and disappearance. This brought me to
think about him : I understood the reasons of his strange
behavior, to which before I had paid no attention, and after

that my thoughts received a new form, which, as I have said
already, was agreeable to me . After I saw that she had not

only the desire for passionate love itself, although she was,
as yet, unconscious of it herself ; that this feeling was
directed towards one who was absolutely worthy, and generally speaking, was absolutely able to fill my place ; that
this man also loved her passionately, - then I became
extremely glad. It is true, however, that the first impression was very cruel ; every important change carries with it


======================================================================

326

some pain.

A VITAL QUESTION.

I saw now that I could not, conscientiously

speaking, look upon myself as a man necessary for her, and
I had become accustomed to this, and to tell the truth, it had

been pleasant to me. Consequently, the severance of this
relation unavoidably had to have its painful side ; but only
for the first part of the time, and not for long, this feeling
predominated over the other feelings, which were joyful in
their nature. Now I was assured of her happiness, and
calm in the contemplation of her fate : this was a source of

great happiness. But it would be vain to think that this
constituted the main source of pleasure ; no, personal feeling was once more much more important.

I saw that I be-

came entirely free from compulsion. My words do not imply
that the life of a bachelor would be easier or happier for me

than family life ; no, if man and wife are not compelled to
any kind of restraint for the sake of pleasing each other ; if
they are content with each other without making effort ; if
they satisfy each other without thinking of the satisfaction , then , the closer the relations between them are , the
freer and easier it is for both of them : but the relation be-

tween her and me was not of this kind ; therefore to separate meant freedom for me .

" From this can be seen that I have acted for my own interests, after I decided not to interfere with her happiness. There

was a lofty side to my action ; but the motive power towards
it was the inclination of my own nature to better myself
alone. Therefore I had strength to act, and, I may say, I
acted well. Not to drift this way and that, not to make unnecessary confusion and disturbance for others, not to be

false to my duty, - this was easy, when the duty is the inclination of your own nature.
" I left for Riazan. After some time she called me back,
saying that my presence would not interfere with her. But
I saw that it would still interfere .

So far as I can

understand, there were two reasons for it.

It was hard for

her to see a man to whom she was exceedingly indebted,
according to her idea. She was mistaken in this respect ;
she was not in the least indebted to me , because I acted much

more for my own interests than hers. But it appeared to her
different, and she felt a very deep gratefulness to me. This
feeling was hard.

There is a pleasant side to it ; but it pre-

dominates only when the feeling is not too strong. When it
is strong it is valid. The second cause- this , again, is a


======================================================================

A VITAL QUESTION.

327

rather embarrassing thing to explain, but I must say what I
think

I find the second cause in the fact that her relations

to society were abnormal and unpleasant ; it was hard for her

•

to endure the fact that society would not acknowledge formally her right to occupy such a position. And so I saw
that my existence near her would be trying for her. I shall
not hide that, in this new discovery, there was a side that
was incomparably harder for me to endure that all feeling
which I had experienced in the former stages of the case. I
had preserved towards her a very strong inclination. I wanted
to remain a very close and intimate friend of hers ; I hoped
that this would be so .

And after I saw that this could not

be, I was greatly grieved ; and here there was no compensation for this grief in personal calculations of any sort whatever. I may say that here my final decision was adopted exclusively, because of my attachment to her, only for the desire
of making her better, exclusively from unselfish motives .
Consequently, never before, even in our happiest time, did
my relations toward her afford me such deep inward satisfaction as this decision .

Here I acted under the action of

what I frankly call nobility, or, to use a more suitable term,
noble calculation , - a calculation in which the general law of
humanity acts exclusively by itself, without borrowing support from individual peculiarities. And here I learned what
a great pleasure it is to feel yourself acting like a noble man ;
that is, as every man ought to act, not Ivan or Peter, but
every man, every one, without distinction of names. What
a lofty delight it is to feel yourself simply a man -not Ivan,
not Peter, but a man, - simply and purely a man ! This
feeling is too strong. Ordinary natures like mine cannot
endure too often an elevation to the height of this feeling ;

but happy is the one who has had the chance to experience
it.

" There is no need of explaining that side of my mode of
action which would have been most unreasonable in transac-

tions with other people, but which here is very obviously justified by the character of the person to whom I yield. At
the time when I left for Riazan, there had not a word passed
between her and Aleksandr Matvéitch ; at the time which
Imade my final decision there had not a word passed between
him and me , or between her and me , on this subject. But I

knew him very well ; I had no need of studying his thoughts
for the sake of learning them."


======================================================================

328

A VITAL QUESTION.

I am giving you Dmitri Sergéitch's words, with liberal exactness , as I have already said.

I am an entire stranger to you ; but the correspondence
into which I enter with you, fulfilling the desire of the late
Dmitri Sergéitch, bears such an intimate character that, in
all probability, it will be interesting for you to learn who this
strange correspondent is, who is so initiated into the inner
life of the late Dmitri Sergéitch.

I used to be a medical

student, and I have nothing more to tell you about myself.
During the last few years I have lived in Petersburg. Several days ago I decided to travel, and to create for myself a
new career abroad . I left Petersburg on the second day
after you learned about Dmitri Sergéitch's catastrophe. On
a certain occasion I had no documents in my possession,

and I had to take the papers belonging to a stranger, with
which I was furnished by one of our common friends. He
gave them to me on the condition that I should fulfil certain
of his commissions on the way. If you happen to see Mr.

Raklımétof, be kind enough to tell him that all his commissions have been fulfilled as he desired.

Now I suppose I

shall have to set out on my travels through Germany,
observing the customs. I have several hundred rubles , and
I want to have a good time. When I shall get tired of idleness , I shall look out for something, no matter what. When ?

wherever chance may lead. I am as free as a bird, and I
can be as unconcerned as a bird ; such a situation delights
me .

It is very probable that you may like to honor me with
an answer, but I do not know where I shall be in a week
from now : maybe in England, and maybe in Prague. I
can go wherever fancy may lead me, and where it will lead
me I know not ; and therefore send your letters to the following address : Berlin, Friedrich Strasse 20, Agentur von H.
Schmeidler. Your envelope should contain another envelope
on which, in place of any address, you will write the cypher
12,345 ; that will show Schmeidler's agency that it should
be forwarded to me .

Accept, honored lady, the assurance of deep respect

A VITAL QUESTION.

HONORED SIR, ALEKSANDR MATVEITCH, —

According to the desire of the late Dmitri Sergéitch, I
must send you the assurance that for him the best circumstance seemed the fact that he was compelled to leave his

place to you. With those relations which brought about this
change, relations which gradually formed, in the course of
three years , from the time when you almost ceased coming to
his house, and therefore were formed without your aid, exclusively from the lack of correspondence between the characters of the two people whom you afterwards tried in vain
to reconcile ; with such relations , the final scene which came

was unavoidable. Evidently Dmitri Sergéitch could not feel
right in blaming you ; of course this explanation is unnecessary ; however, merely for form's sake, he authorized me
to make it. Thus it had to be either one way or the other :
either you or he had to take the place which he could not fill,
and which another could take only because Dmitri Sergéitch
could not fill it ; and the fact that you took this place , ac-

cording to the opinion of the late Dmitri Sergéitch makes
the best result that could be devised. I press your hand.

" Ah ! I know."

What is that ?

A familiar voice.

I turn around ; there

he is ! He, himself, the sapient reader, who was not long
ago banished in disgrace for not knowing A from B,¹ in
regard to the artistic, but here he is again and again with
his former shrewdness. Again he knows something !
" Ah ! I know who wrote it- "

But I hastily seize the first thing that comes most convenient for my purpose. I seize a napkin, because after I copied the former student's letter, I sat down to breakfast, and

so I seize the napkin, and stuff it in his mouth, " Well,
keep what you know to yourself; why do you shout it all
over town ? "
II .

PETERSBURG, Aug. 25, 1856.
DEAR SIR, -

You will understand what a degree of happiness your letter
gave me. With all my soul I thank you for it. Your intimacy with the late Dmitri Sergéitch gives me the right to re1 Aza for glaza, literally, does not recognize a when he has it in his eyes.


======================================================================

A VITAL QUESTION.

gard you as my friend. Allow me to use this appellation.
In every word which you quoted can be seen Dmitri Sergéitch's character. He was constantly seeking for the most
secret causes of his actions, and he took pleasure in ascribing
them to his theory of egotism. By the way, this is the common custom of all our society. My Aleksandr is also fond
of analyzing his motives in exactly the same spirit. If you
had only heard how he explained his behavior towards me
and Dmitri Sergéitch in the course of three years, you would
learn, if his words were to be taken literally, that he did
everything through egotistical calculation for his own pleasure. And I long ago learned this custom ; it interests Aleksandr and me a trifle less than it interested Dmitri Sergéitch.
We agree with him entirely ; but he has a stronger drawing
towards it. Yes , if one were to hear us , all three of us would
be taken to be such egotists as the world has never seen. And

maybe this is true ; maybe there never were such egotists.
What think you ? Yes ; it seems likely.
But besides this characteristic, common to us three, in

Dmitri Sergéitch's words there is another, which belongs exclusively to his situation. Apparently the aim of his explanations was to give me peace.

Not that his words lack

sincerity, - no, he would never say what he does not think,
but he brings out too strongly only that element of the
truth which can calm me. My friend, I am very grateful for
it ; but I, too, am an egoistka. I shall tell you that he vainly
worried over my peace of mind. We justify ourselves much
easier than we are justified by others ; and I, to tell the truth,
do not consider myself in any way blameworthy before him.
Iwill say further, I do not even feel that I owe him any grate-

fulness . I prize his nobility, oh, how deeply ! but I know
that he was noble, not for my sake, but his own. For I ,
when I was not false to him, was not false , not for his sake,

but for myself; not because falsity would be injurious to
him, but to myself.
I said that I did not blame myself, just as he did. But,
just as he did, I feel an inclination to justify myself. Ac-

cording to his words, which were very just, this means : I
have a presentiment that others will not be as lenient as I am
towards myself, in exempting me from the blame of certain
parts of my behavior. I do not feel any desire whatsoever
to justify myself for that part of the affair in which he justified himself ; and, on the contrary, I want to justify myself


======================================================================

A VITAL QUESTION.

331

for that part in which he had no need for giving justification.
In all that happened until I had my dream there was nothing
for which anybody will blame me, I am convinced. But
afterwards , was not I the cause of the affair taking such a

melodramatic course, and brought about such a terrible catastrophe ? Ought I not to have looked much more rationally
on that change of relations which was unavoidable, after my
dream had for the first time revealed to me and Dmitri Ser-

géitch his situation and mine ? The very evening of the day
on which Dmitri Sergéitch committed suicide, I had a long
talk with the formidable Rakhmétof
der-hearted man he is !

and what a kind, ten-

He told me God-knows-what horri-

ble things about Dmitri Sergéitch.

But if I repeated them

in a friendly tone to Dmitri Sergéitch , instead of in the harsh,
as it were, unfriendly, tone which Rakhmétof used, - well,
they may be true. I suspect that Dmitri Sergéitch understood well what Rakhmétof was going to say to me, and that
this formed a part of his calculation. Yes, at that time it
was necessary for me to listen to it ; it calmed me greatly ;
and whoever might have arranged for that talk, I acknowledge my gratitude for it to you, my friend. But even the

formidable Rakhmétof had to acknowledge that, in the last
part of the affair, Dmitri Sergéitch acted finely. Rakhmétof
blamed him only for the first half, and for this he was justifying himself. I am going to justify myself, though nobody
has told me that I was to blame for it.

But for every one

of us - I am speaking about you and our friends, about all
our circle - there is a severer than even Rakhmétof , and
this is our own conscience .

Yes, I comprehend, my friend, that it would have been
far easier for all concerned if I had looked at the matter

more simply, and had not given to it a too tragical importance. According to Dmitri Sergéitch's view, it should have
been put this way more strongly ; although there would
have been no need of having recourse to a conclusion so
theatrical and trying for all of us, yet he was led to it only
by the superfluous vehemence of my anxiety. I understand
how it must have seemed so to him, although he did not
charge you to put that view of it before me. So much the
more I appreciate his kind disposition towards me, that it
was not diminished even though he held such an opinion.
But just listen a moment, my friend. It is not entirely just ;

it is not by any means unjust ; it was not from my fault ; it


======================================================================

332

A VITAL QUESTION.

was not from my superfluous anxiety that the absolute
necessity came upon Dmitri Sergéitch of examining into
what he himself frequently called a trying situation. True,
if I had not attributed an excessive importance to the

change in our relations , it might have been possible to escape
the difficulty without the journey to Riazan ; but he said that

it was not trying for him, and so there would not have been
still greater misfortunes arising from my exalted views .
Only the necessity of making way with himself was trying
for Dmitri Sergéitch. He explained the unavoidableness of
this decision of his by two reasons : I was suffering from an
excessive feeling of gratitude towards him ; I was suffering
because I could not enter into those relations with Alek-

sandr which are demanded by the conditions of society.

In reality, I was not thoroughly at ease ; I was oppressed by
the situation, until he made way with himself ; but he did
not suspect the essential reason .

The thought that his

appearance oppressed me with an excessive burden of gratitude was not absolutely true. A person is very much
inclined to seek for reasons which may lighten a trying
situation , and at the time when Dmitri Sergéitch saw the
necessity of making way with himself, this reason for it was
no longer in existence.

My gratitude to him had long be-

fore been modified to such a degree that it became a pleasant feeling ; and only this reason was connected with my
previous exalted view of the matter.

The other reason

which Dmitri Sergéitch adduced, - the desire to give to my
relations with Aleksandr a character such as is recognized,

- that reason had nothing to do with my view of the matter ; it resulted from the ideas of society.

I was powerless

over it. But Dmitri Sergéitch was entirely mistaken in
thinking that his presence would have been hard for me on
account of that reason. No ; it might have been arranged
otherwise even without the necessity of his committing

suicide, if it had been necessary and had been satisfactory
to me. Our position had that rare peculiarity that all the
three persons who were concerned in it were of equal
strength .
If Dmitri Sergéitch had felt that Aleksandr

were his superior in intellect, culture, or character ; if, while
yielding his place to Aleksandr, he would through a superiority of mental strength ; if his refusal had not been from
good will, instead of the yielding of a stronger to a weaker, -

then, of course, I should have had no cause to be burdened.


======================================================================

A VITAL QUESTION.

333

Likewise , if I had been in intellect or character much

stronger than Dmitri Sergéitch ; if until my relations with
Aleksandr had received their full development he had been

what has been well characterized by a story over which you
will remember we were at one time all greatly amused - the
story of how two gentlemen met in the foyer of the opera ,

engaged in conversation with each other, took a fancy to
each other, and wanted to get better acquainted.

" I am

Lieutenant So-and-so," says the one, introducing himself ;
66

And I am the husband of Madame Tedesco,
Tedesco," said the

other, introducing himself.

If Dmitri Sergéitch had been

the husband of Madame Tedesco, then, of course , there

would have been no necessity of his committing suicide.
He would have been under such subjection and humiliation ;
and if he had been a noble man, he would see in the fact of

his humiliation nothing offensive to himself, and all would be
well .

But Dmitri's

relation towards me and Aleksandr

was in no respect analogous . He was not a hair's breadth
lower or weaker than either of us , and we knew it and he
knew it.

His concession was not the result of weakness .

Oh, not at all. It was merely the result of his good will.
Wasn't that so, my friend ? You cannot deny it. Therefore, in what situation did I find myself placed ! And this,
my friend, contains the whole essence of the matter.

I saw

myself in a situation of dependence on his good will, and so
my situation was trying to me, and therefore he saw himself
compelled to the heroic decision of putting himself out of

the way.

Yes, my friend, the cause of my feeling, which

compelled him to it, lay much deeper than his explanation
given in your letter. The overwhelming weight of gratefulness was no longer in existence .

To satisfy the claims

of society would have been easy in the way that Dmitri
Sergéitch suggested. Yes ; the claims of society would
never affect me living in my own little circle, which is
entirely free from such claims ; but I was still dependent
upon Dmitri Sergéitch. My situation had as its foundation
only his good will, and that was not self-existent, and that
was the reason why it was hard for me. Now, judge you :
could this cause be removed by this view of a change in our

relations, or by the other. The importance lay not in my
views of it, but in the fact that Dmitri Sergéitch was a man

of independence, who acted according to his own will,
though it was a good will. Yes, my friend, you know and


======================================================================

334

A VITAL QUESTION.

you approve of my feeling. I do not want to be dependent
upon the good will of any one, no matter who it may be,
though it were a man most devoted to me, though I respected him, though I might trust him as I do myself,
though I absolutely knew that he would always rejoice to do
whatever I needed, that my happiness was as dear to him as
to myself. Yes, my friend, I do not need your assurance ;
I know that you approve of it.
But after all, why all this talk, this self-analysis, which
reveals the most hidden motives of feelings which could not
be penetrated by any one? Yet, with me as with Dmitri
Sergéitch, this self-confession is made for my own benefit,
so that I might say, " I am not to blame here ; the matter
depended on something that was beyond my control." I
make this remark because Dmitri Sergéitch was fond of
such remarks. I want to praise myself before you, my
friend.

But enough of this.¹ You felt so much sympathy for me
that you did not grudge spending several hours' time in writ-

ing your long letter - and oh, how precious it was to me !
I see from this letter how diplomatically I have learned to
write- in a style like Dmitri Sergéitch's or yours ; yes ,
from this, and only from this, I see how interesting it will
be for you to know what happened to me after Dmitri Sergéitch took leave from me, on his way to Moscow, with the

intention of returning and disappearing. After his return
from Riazan he saw that I was disturbed.

This disturbance

was manifested only on his return. While he was staying in
Riazan , I, to tell you the truth, did not think about him

much ; no, not as much as you might suppose, judging by
what he saw after his return. But when he left for Moscow,
I saw that he had something particular in view. It was

noticeable that he wound up his business in Petersburg ; it
was evident that for a week he was waiting for their final
issue in order to go, and then -how could it happen otherwise? During the last days I noticed the melancholy in
his face - that face which was so clever at hiding mysteries ;
I anticipated that something decisive was in prospect , and
when he took his place in the car, I felt so sad, so sad ! On

the next day I was melancholy ; on the third day I got up
still more oppressed, and suddenly Masha brought me a

letter. What a tormenting moment it was, what a tormenting hour, what a tormenting day, you can imagine !
And so, my friend, now more than before, I know my
attachment to Dmitri Sergéitch. I myself did not realize
that it was so powerful. Yes , my friend, I now know its
strength . You, too, know, because you must certainly know
that on that very day I decided to give up Aleksandr. All
day I felt that my life was ruined poisoned forever. Can
you imagine my childish exultation when I saw my kind
friend's note, which entirely changed the current of my
thoughts (you see how careful my expressions are ; I want
you to be satisfied with me, my friend) . You know all this ,
because Rakhmétof went to escort me to the train.

Dmitri

Sergéitch and he were right in saying that it was necessary
for me to leave Petersburg for the accomplishment of the
effect, for the sake of which Dmitri Sergéitch did not scruple to leave me all day a prey to the most terrible tortures :
how thankful I am to him for this unmercifulness !

He and

Rakhmétof were also right in advising Aleksandr not to
come to me , nor to escort me . But I had no necessity of
going to Moscow ; it was only necessary for me to go as far

as Moscow, so I stopped at Novgorod. A few days later
Aleksandr came there, and brought the documents in regard
to Dmitri Sergéitch's suicide. We were married a week after
the suicide , and we lived a month on the railroad in Tchudof,
so that Aleksandr might be enabled to go three or four times

a week to the hospital. Yesterday we returned to Petersburg, and here is the reason that I have been so long
answering your letter : it lay in Masha's drawer, and she

had entirely forgotten about it. And you must have thought
God knows what - at not having received an answer during all this time.

I salute you, dear friend, yours,
VIÉRA KIRSANOVA.

I press your hand, my dear. But please don't write any
compliments to me, else I shall pour out before you my
whole soul , and a perfect flood of enconiums on your nobleness , which would be the worst thing imaginable, and do
you know what I think ? Does it not prove the presence of
a pretty good amount of stupidity, both in you and in me,
by writing each other only a few lines. It seems as though

THESE letters, absolutely sincere, were really somewhat
warped , as Viéra Pavlovna herself noticed. Both correspondents of course were trying to diminish for each other the

strength of the heavy shocks which they experienced.
these people are shrewd !

Oh,

I have often heard from them -

that is , from them and people of their stamp - such things
as made me laugh in spite of their pathetical assurances that
such and such a thing was easy to endure. Of course I
laughed when the assurances were made before me who was
a stranger to them and talking with them in tête-à-tête. And

when the very same thing was said to a man who had to listen to it, then I used to admit that such and such things were
really trifles . An honorable man is a most amusing creature.
I always used to laugh at all the honorable men with whom I
was acquainted. A most amusing creature, even to the point
of absurdity ! Here , let us take these letters. I am partially

used to tricks of this sort, even while entertaining friendship
with such gentlemen and ladies. Well (nu) , but what effect
can they have on a man who is inexperienced and as yet unspoiled , as , for instance, the sapient reader ?
The sapient reader already is clearing his mouth of the nap-

kin, and, while shaking his head, says :
" Immorality ! "

" You are a fine fellow ! You have hit it! " I reply in
praise of him. " Well [nu] , make me happy with another
little word ! "

" Yes , the author himself is an immoral man," declares the
sapient reader. " Just see what things he approves of ! "

" No, my precious, you are mistaken. There are many
things that I do not approve of here. Possibly I do not approve of any of it, if you desire to hear the truth. All this
is too much idealized. too ecstatic ! Life is much simpler. "

demands the sapient reader, opening wide eyes of astonishment at the incomprehensible degree of immorality to which
humanity has fallen in my personage !
" Much more immoral," I say, uncertain whether the sapient reader will accept it as truth or will ridicule it.
This correspondence lasted for three or four months , - ас-

tively on the part of Kirsánof, but carelessly and briefly on
the part of their correspondent.

Afterwards he entirely

ceased to answer their letters, and it could be seen by all that
his sole idea was to impart to Viéra Pavlovna and her hus-

band thoughts of Lopukhóf, which made up the long letter
which he wrote first, and after fulfilling this obligation he
considered the further correspondence unnecessary. After
two or three of Kirsánof's letters remained unanswered, he
understood it so and ceased to write.

IV.

VIÉRA PAVLOVNA is resting on her soft lounge, expecting
her husband home to dinner from the hospital. To-day she
has been busying herself very little in the kitchen over the
sweet additions to dinner.

She wanted to lie down even

sooner, so as to rest, because she worked very hard this morn-

ing ; and it had been so for a long time, and it will be so for
a long time to come : she has had much to do in the mornings .

Here she is trying to establish another union shop in another
part of the town. Viéra Pavlovna Lopukhóva lived on the
Vasilyevsky Island ; Viéra Pavlovna Kirsánova lives on Syérgievskaïa Street, because her husband had to have an apartment near the Vinborgsky Side. Mrs. Mertsálova proved to
be very capable in her management of the shop on the Vasilyevsky Island ; and that was not to be wondered at, for she
and the members of the union had been very good friends .
After Viéra Pavlovna returned to Petersburg, she saw that,
though she had to be at the shop, it was only for short visits ;

that if she continued to go there every day, it was simply because she was drawn there by her attachment, and that her
friends liked to have her come.

Perhaps for some time her

calls did not prove to be useless , since Mertsálova at times
found it necessary to consult with her.

But it took so little

time and becomes continually more and more rare, and soon
Mertsálova will gain so much experience that she will cease


======================================================================

A VITAL QUESTION.

to need Viéra Pavlovna.

Yes , even the first time after her

return to Petersburg that she was at the shop on the Vasilyevsky Island, she was more like a loving friend than an important factor. What had she to do ? It is evident what.
It was necessary for her to start another shop in the new
neighborhood where she lived, at the other end of the city .

And so the new shop is established in one of the short
streets which runs between Basséinaïa and Syérgievskaïa
streets .

There was much less bother with it than with the

former.

The five girls who formed the fundamental staff

came over from the old shop, while new girls took their
places. The balance of the force was selected from among
the good acquaintances of those seamstresses who worked in

the other shop, and that shows that everything was more than
half prepared. The aim and order of the shop were well
known to all the members of the union, and new girls entered
the shop with the desire that the arrangement so slowly developed in the other shop should be immediately begun. Oh ,
yes, now the arrangement progresses tenfold quicker than
before , and there is three times less worriment.

But still

there is a great deal of work, and Viéra Pavlovna is just as
tired to-day as she was yesterday and the day before, as she
was two months ago, only two months, though half a year
has passed since her marriage. Well, it was necessary for
her to enjoy a wedding festival, and she enjoyed it long, but
afterwards she gave herself up to work.
Yes, she has been working hard to-day, and now she is
resting, and she is thinking about many things, and, above
all, about the present ; it is full of all good ! It is so full of
life that she has scarcely time to have recollections. Recollections will come later, oh, much later ; and not even in ten

years , nor, perhaps, in a score ofyears, but later. Now it
is not time for them, and it will not be for many years to
come.

But still she has a few even now ; seldom, to be sure .

Here , for example, she recollects something which seldom
comes to her mind.

Here is what she recollects :

V.

" Milenki, I am going with thee ."
" But you have not your things ready."
" Milenki mine, then I will go with you to-morrow, if you
do not want to take me to-day ."


======================================================================

339

A VITAL QUESTION.

" Think it over ; consider it. Wait for my letter ; it will
reach you to-morrow."
Here she returns home .

How did she feel when she went

home with Masha ? How did she feel and think all the long

way from the Moscow railway station to the Middle Prospekt ? She herself does not know, so shocked was she by
the abrupt turn in the affair. Twenty-four hours have not
passed --no , in two hours it will be a full day- since he
found her letter in his room, and now he is already gone.
How quick ! how sudden !

At two o'clock she had not anti-

cipated anything of the sort. He waited until she, wearied
by the excitement of the morning, could not longer resist the
power of sleep, came in, said a few words, and in these few
words there was an almost incomprehensible preface to what
he meant ; and in what brief words he said what he meant !
He said : " I have not seen my old folks for a long time. I

am going to see them, and they will be glad to have me come."
That was all, and he left immediately ; and she hastened after
him, though, when he came in, he asked her to promise not
to do it. She hastened after him ; but where was he ?
" Masha, where is he ? where is he ? "
Masha, who was still putting away the things after the

departure of the guests, says , " Dmitri Sergéitch has gone
out. He said, after he came out from your room, ' I am going to take a walk. " And she had to go to bed ; and how
could she go to sleep ? But she did not know that this was

going to take place on the very morning which was now beginning to dawn. He said that they would have abundant
time to talk everything over. And she had barely time to
open her eyes before it was time to go to the railway station .

Yes, all this had flashed by her eyes, as though nothing of
the sort had happened to her, as though some one had told

her of something that happened to some one else.

Only

now, while returning home from the railway station , she came
to herself, and began to think, " What is the matter with

me, and what is going to happen to me ? "
Yes, she is going to Riazan. She is going ; it is impossible not to go .

But this letter ; what will be in that letter ?

No ; why wait for the letter before deciding ?

She knows

what it will contain : still she must postpone her decision till

the letter comes . Why postpone it? She will go ; yes , she
will go ! She thinks about it one hour ; she thinks two ; she
thinks three, four hours . But Masha was getting hungry,


======================================================================

340

A VITAL QUESTION.

and for the third time has summoned her to dinner ; and this
time she commands her, rather than summons her. Well,
this is another recollection .

" Poor Masha ! how I com-

pelled her to get hungry ! ”

" Why did you wait for me, Masha ! Why did not you
have your dinner long ago, without waiting for me ? "
" How could I, Viéra Pavlovna ? ”
And she thinks again for one hour, two hours. " I am
going ; yes, I am going to-morrow. I shall only wait for the
letter because he asked me to. But whatever may be written in it, and I know what will be in it ,-it does not make
any difference what it says, I shall go ."
On this she thinks an hour, two hours. Yes , she deliberates over it an hour ; but does she deliberate over it two

hours ? No, though she thinks about it ; but she thinks five
little words more , " He does not wish it."

And more and

more she deliberates over these five little words.

And here

the sun is already setting ; but she still thinks the same
thoughts , and, above all, the five little words ; and suddenly,
just at the very instant that the indefatigable Masha was demanding that Viéra Pavlovna should come out to tea, at that
very moment, out from those five little words arise six little
words, " I do not wish it either." How well the indefatigable
Masha acted in coming in! She drove away these six new
little words . But even the beneficent Masha did not long

succeed in driving away these six little words. At first they
did not dare to appear by themselves ; they sent in their
place a refutation of themselves , “ But I must go."

And

they sent them for the sake of returning themselves , under
the cover of this refutation. At one instant appeared with
them their carrier, " He does not wish it " ; and at that very

instant these five little words changed into the six little words,
" I do not wish it either ."

And she goes over these thoughts for half an hour ; and in
half an hour these five little words, the six little words, begin
to work over, according to their own will, even the former
words , the most important words of all.

And from the three

words, most important of all, " I shall go," grow four words,
not the same as before , though they are the same, " But
shall I go ? " Thus it is that words grow, and transform
themselves . But here comes Masha again. " I gave him a
silver ruble , Viéra Pavlovna ; here it is written . ' If he brings

it at nine o'clock, give him a silver ruble ; but if later, give

letter ; " Don't go."

Yes , she knows what is in the

But still she means to go. She does

not want to listen to this lettr, - to him ; she intends to go ;

she is going. No, there is something different in the letter ;
here is something to which it is impossible not to listen : “ I
am going to Riazan, but not directly to Riazan. I have a
great deal to do for the factory on the way. Besides Moscow, where I shall have to stay a week, I shall have to stop
at two towns this side of Moscow, and three on the other

side before I reach Riazan. How long I shall stay at my
various halting-points I cannot tell you, for the very reason,
that among other things, I shall have to receive money from

our mercantile correspondents, and you know, my dear
friend "
yes; it was in the letter. " My dear friend was
used several times in the letter that I might see that he felt
towards me as before ; that he had no ill towards me ," thinks

Viéra Pavlovna. " At that time I kissed those words my
dear friend ; yes, it was so : ' My dear friend, you know
that, when it is necessary to receive money, you are often

compelled to stay several days, when you intended to stay
only a few hours ; and so I really do not know when I shall

be able to reach Riazan ; by all probability, not very soon .'”
She remembers this letter almost word for word . What

does it mean ? Yes, he has entirely deprived her of the possibility of clinging to him, so as to preserve her relations to
him . What is left for her to do ? And her former words ,
" I must go to him," change into the words , " No , I must
not see him ," and this him does not refer to the one of whom

she was just thinking. These words change all her former
words , and she thinks one hour ; she thinks two , “ I must

not see him " ; and how and when did they succeed in
changing ? but they have already changed into the words :
Shall I really ever want to see him again ? No ! " and
when she falls asleep these words have changed into other

words , " Shall I really ever see him ? " and where is the
answer ? Where is he gone? And these again change, yes ,
they grew into the words, " Shall I never see him again ? "
And when she falls asleep at daybreak she falls asleep with

these same words , " Shall I really never see him again ? "
And when she wakes late in the morning already, instead

of all other words, only five words are wrestling with two,
" I shall not see him ; I shall see him " ' ; and thus passes
the whole morning. Everything is forgotten ; everything is
forgotten in this struggle, and the more powerful word no
tries to conquer the little word yes ; it tackles it ; it clutches

it. " I shall not see him " ; and the little word glances
aside and vanishes, glances aside and vanishes . " Yes , I
shall see him. " Everything is forgotten ; everything is forgotten in the effort of the stronger word no to conquer the

smaller one yes. Yes, and it does conquer, and it calls to its
aid other little words, so that the former little word may
have no refuge.

" No , I shall not see him ; no, I shall not

see him ! " Yes, now the stronger words hold firmly in their
grasp the little word yes, which has no refuge from them ;
they press it between them : " No, I shall not see - no, I
shall see him - no , I shall not see him ! " But what is she

doing now ? Her bonnet was already on her head ; instinctively she looked at the mirror to see if her hair is in order ;
yes, in the mirror she saw that her bonnet is on straight,
and from these words, which have grown together so firmly,
one remained, and to this a new one was added, " No return ! no return ! "

" Masha, don't expect me back to dinner !

I shall not

dine at home to-day."
" Aleksandr Matvéitch has not returned yet from the hos-

pital," calmly replied Stepan ; and how could he help speaking calmly with a phlegmatic lady ? In her appearance there
is nothing out of the ordinary ; not very long ago she used to
be here .

" I did not think he was ; it's all right ; I will wait ; you
need not tell him that I am here ."

She unfolds some newspaper or other - yes , she can read ;

she sees that she can read ; yes , as long as there is " no return " ; as long as the decision is made, she feels herself
quite calm. Of course she can read little; she scarcely read
at all ; she looked at the room ; she began to put it in order,
as though she were its khzoyáïka . Of course she did not

arrange it much, scarcely at all : but how calm she feels , and
she can read, and she can occupy herself with something .
She noticed that the ashes had not been emptied from the

that the chair was out of its place. She is sitting and thinking : " There is no return - no choice ! A new life is beginning. " She thinks an hour, two hours : " A new life is beginning. How surprised he will be ! how happy he will be !
A new life is beginning ! how happy we are ! "
A tinkling bell ! she flushed a little, and smiled ; steps the door opens !
" Viéra Pavlovna ! "

" My love [drug moï] , I could not live without thee.
How long thou didst love me, and said not a word. How
noble thou art !

How noble he is, Sasha ! "

" Tell me, Viérotchka, how it happened."
" I told him that I could not live without thee : on the very

next evening he had already gone ; I wanted to follow him ;
I talked all day yesterday about following him, but now thou
seest that I have been here a long time."

"But how thin thou hast grown these past two weeks,
Viérotchka !

How pale thy hands are ! "

He kisses her hands .

" Yes , my dear, this has been a hard struggle. Now I can

appreciate how much you suffered, so as not to disturb my
peace. How could you be so self-possessed as to hide it from
me ?

How thou must have suffered ! "

" No, Viérotchka ; it was not an easy task."

He still kisses her hands, looking at them, and suddenly
she burst into laughter.

" Ath ! how inattentive I am to you.

You are tired,

Sasha ; you must be hungry."
She frees herself from him, and runs away.

" Where are you going, Viérotchka ? "
But she answers never a word, but goes to the kitchen,
and hurriedly, gayly, says to Stepan : “ Hurry up ; let us
have dinner for two ! hurry up - where are the plates and
things ! Let me have them ; I will set the table myself, and

you bring the victuals. Aleksandr is so tired from his hospital that we must give him something to eat."
She comes back with the plates, and the knives, forks ,
and spoons rattle on the plates .
Stepan puts the soup on the table. At dinner she relates
how it all happened.

Stepan comes in with the last dish .

" Stepan, seems to me that we shall not leave you any
dinner ."

" Yes, Viéra Pavlovna ; I shall have to buy something
for myself in the little grocery store."
" That's all right, Stepan; henceforth you must know
that you must prepare for two besides yourself."
And after she remembers all this , Viéra Pavlovna smiles

and " now how prosaic our story is ! "
Tea was not over when we heard a terrible ringing of the
bell, and in came a couple of students, and in their excitement they did not even notice her.

" Aleksandr Matvéitch, there is an interesting subject,"
say they, all out of breath ; " it was brought just now
a very rare complication ; it's very interesting, Aleksandr
Matvéitch, and immediate help is wanted. Every moment
is precious ; we even took an izvoshchik to come here."
" Make haste, my dear," she says ; and here for the first
time the students notice her.

They bow to her , and at that

very moment they hurry away their professor with them.
His preparations did not take very long ; he was still in his
army coat, and she hurried him away. " Will you come
right to me afterwards ? " she asked, as she said good by.
" Yes . "

Long she waits for him through the evening ; here it is
ten o'clock, and he hasn't come yet ; now it is eleven ; now
there is no use waiting ; still what can be the reason ?

She ,

of course, did not worry at all. Nothing could have happened to him ; but it shows how long he was detained by
the interesting subject, and is the poor interesting subject
alive now, and does Sasha succeed in saving him ? Yes,
Sasha was detained very long. He came in the next
morning at ten o'clock. He stayed till four at the hospital.
" It was a very hard and interesting case, Viérotchka."
" Did you save him ? "
" Yes ."

" How did you get up so early ? "
" I didn't go to bed at all."
" You didn't go to bed ? So as not to be late coming to

see me ? You didn't sleep all night ? You impious fellow !
Please go right home and sleep clear till dinner-time without

dinner goes with proper dignity. They tell each other their
stories sensibly ; they laugh, they think, and they pity each
other. To each of them it seems that the other has suffered the more . In a week and a half a little datcha on

the Kamennoï Ostrof is rented, and they move there.
VI .

VIÉRA PAVLOVNA does not very often recollect the past

days of their present love. Yes, in the present there is so
much life that there is little recollection ; but whenever she

recalls the past, as sometimes , at first, of course, only
sometimes , but afterwards more frequently, - at every recollection she feels a dissatisfaction, at first, weak and like

a flash , indefinite. At whom? at what ? and then it appears
to her.

At whom ?

She is dissatisfied with herself.

For

what ? And now she sees from what part of her character

arises her dissatisfaction . Yes ; she is very proud. But is
it only in her past that she is dissatisfied with herself? At
first, yes ; but then she begins to observe that the dissatisfaction with herself is connected with the present also.
And what a strange peculiarity could be noticed in this
feeling, after it became clear to her, as though she, Viéra
Pavlovna Kirsánova, did not feel a personal dissatisfaction,
but as though the dissatisfaction of thousands and millions
were not reflected in her ; and as though she were not dissat-

isfied with herself personally, but as though these thousands
and millions were dissatisfied with her.

But who are these

thousands and millions ? Why are they dissatisfied with
themselves ? If I had lived alone by myself as before, she

thought to herself, that then, by all probability, this feeling
would not have been made manifest so quickly to her. But
now she is constantly with her husband. They both think
together all the time, and the thought about him interferes

with every other thought. This assisted greatly in the
evolution of this feeling. He could not directly explain
this puzzle to her ; as long as this feeling was obscure in her
own mind, it was still darker for him.

For him it was hard

to think how it is possible to feel dissatisfaction which

should not interfere with your personal satisfaction, which
does not in the least bear upon personality. This was
strange to him, a hundred-fold darker than for her; but still


======================================================================

346

it helped her a great deal that she was constantly thinking
about her husband and constantly thinking with him. She
began to notice that whenever this dissatisfaction came to

her, it was always accompanied by comparisons. It consisted in the fact that she compares herself with her husband, and here flashed before her a real word expressing her
thought, " a difference, an insulting difference." Now she
understands .

" SASHA, how lovely this N. N. is (Viéra Pavlovna named
the officer with whom she wanted to become acquainted with

Tambulik and Bosio in her dream) ; he brought me a new
poem, which is not soon going to be published," said Viéra
Pavlovna at dinner. " Shall we set ourselves to reading it
right after dinner? Yes ? I have been waiting for you, and
I am going to read it all with you, Sasha. And I have been
longing to read it."
" What poem is it ? "
" Now you shall hear.

Let us see if he succeeded in this

N. N. says that he - I mean the author -is pretty

well satisfied with it ."

And so they settle themselves comfortably in her room, and
she begins to read :
" Oi ! full, full the little basket is
With brocades and calicoes !

Sweetheart, pity ! what a task it is
For the young lad as he goes ! " 1

" Now I see," said Kirsánof, after listening to a score or
so of stanzas ; " this is a new style with him ; but it is evi-

dently his. Nekrasof's ?? Yes ? I am very grateful to you
for waiting for me . "

" You ought to be," replied Viéra Pavlovna. Twice they
read the little poem over, which, owing to their acquaintance
with one of the author's acquaintances, came into their hands
three years before it was published.
The original metre. The literal translation is as follows: Oi! full, full, the little

basket; There is calicoes and brocades. Have pity, my little chilblain. On the

as the " people's poet " (naród nui poet) .


======================================================================

347

A VITAL QUESTION.

" Do you know what verses affected me the most ? " asked
Viéra Pavlovna, after she had read several times with her
husband certain parts of the poem. " These verses are not

from the main part of the poem, but oh ! my thoughts are
greatly drawn to them. When Katya was waiting for the return of her bridegroom, she was very melancholy : 'Had I only time for worrying
I should die, thou heartless one !
Harvest time, and time is hurrying ;
Scores of things must now be done !
' Though it often to the maiden comes
That she suffers and must sigh ,
Still the hay-cart heavy laden comes,
Still the sickle burns the rye.
' She must thresh with all her might alas !
Thresh the grain the morning through ;
Spread the flax at gloomy night, alas !
On the meadows wet with dew . ' 1

These verses are not the principal ones in that episode : they
are only a preface to the fact how this lovely Katya is dream-

ing about her life with Vanja ; but my thoughts are greatly
drawn to them ."

" Yes, that is a perfect picture, one of the very best in
the poem. But they do not hold the best place in it, so they
must have corresponded very closely to the thoughts which
occupied you. What are these thoughts ? "
" They are these, Sasha.

You and I have often said that

the organization of woman is almost higher than that of man ,
and that therefore woman may force man to take second rank
in intellectual life, when the rough force which predominates
at the present time shall pass. We both have come to this
conclusion by observation of life; you meet more women in
life than men who are intellectual by nature.

So it seems to

us both. You confirmed this by various facts drawn from
anatomy and physiology."
" What offensive things you are speaking about man, and
you say a great deal more than I do about it, Viérotchka. It

'tis harvest, pressing; it is necessary to finish ten things , however often it happens
beyond the young woman's endurance. Under the scythe the grass falls ; under the

is insulting to me ! It is good that the time which you predict is very far off, else I should entirely change my opinion,
so as not to go into the second rank.

However, Viérotchka,

this is only a probability ; science has not collected enough
data to settle this question positively. "

" Of course, my dear. We said that until this time the
facts of history point to a different conclusion, though it is
very probable, as we observe private life and the arrangement of the organism, woman has until lately played such a
trifling part in intellectual life, because the predominating
force deprived her of the means of culture and the motives
for reaching development. This explanation is sufficient.
But here is another similar case . If woman is measured by

her physical strength, her organism is much weaker ; but her
organism is stronger. Isn't that so ? "
" This is much less dubious than the question as to the
natural endowment of intellectual strength. Yes, a woman's
organism offers a much stronger resistance to material forces

of destruction,- climate, weather, and unhealthy food. Medicine and physiology have occupied themselves very little with
the detailed investigation of this ; but statistics have given
an indisputable general answer that the average length of
woman's life is more than man's .

From this it can be seen

that woman's organism is stronger. "
" So much the more strikingly can it be seen that the style

of woman's life is generally far less healthful than man's ! "
" There is another important consideration by which the
clearness of the result is made more manifest, and that is

offered by physiology. Full maturity is reached rather sooner
by woman than by man. Let us suppose that a woman's
growth ends at twenty and a man's at twenty-five, - approximately in our climate and in our race. Let us suppose also ,
approximately , that the same proportion of women reach the
age of seventy as of men who reach the age of sixty-five.
If we consider the difference in the periods of growth, the
preponderance of strength in woman's organism will appear
much more strikingly even than statistics grant, which do
not take into consideration the difference in the periods of
maturity. Seventy years means three and a half times
twenty years . Sixty-five should be divided by twenty-five :
how much will it be? Yes , it will go two and a half times ,
with a remainder - that is , two and three-fifths .

Therefore

a woman lives three and a half periods of her full develop


======================================================================

A VITAL QUESTION.

349

ment as easily as a man lives only two and a half periods of
his. And by this proportion is measured the strength of her
organism."

" Indeed, there is a greater difference than I had believed ."

" Yes, but I mentioned this only for example ; I took
round numbers , and depended on my memory. However,
the conclusion is exactly as I said. Statistics show that
woman's organism is stronger. You got your conclusions
only from the tables of life averages. But if the physiological facts are added to the statistical, the difference will
be still greater. "

" That is so, Sasha ; just consider what I was thinking,
and now it comes over me more strongly still. I was thinking, if a woman's organism resists more powerfully the
destructive impressions of matter, then it is altogether likely
that woman should have greater strength in bearing mental
shocks . But in reality we see that she is different."
" Yes, this is likely. Of course, so far this is only a supposition ; this has not been studied ; no special facts have
been gathered. But really, your conclusion results so closely
from the fact which is already undisputed that it is hard to
distrust it. The strength of the organism is too closely connected with the strength of the nerves . In all likelihood
woman's nerves are more elastic, have a stronger structure ;

and if that is so, then they must more easily and firmly
endure shocks and painful feelings. But in reality we see
many examples of the contrary. A woman very often suffers
torments over what a man bears easily. The analysis of the
cause by which we see in real life such phenomena, contradicting what we ought to expect from the structure itself of

her organism, has not yet been made with sufficient accuracy.
But one of these causes is evident ; it pervades all historical
phenomena, and all the sides of our actual existence .

This

is a strength of prejudice, a bad habit, a false expectation ,
a false fear.

If a man thinks, ' I can't,' then he really

can't. It is constantly drummed into women's ears, ' You
are weak,' and so they feel that they are weak, and they
really become weak. We have seen examples where people,
absolutely healthy, have drooped till they really died, from
the one idea that they were bound to grow weak and die.
But there are examples which affect whole masses, nations ,

humanity in general. One of the most remarkable of these

is the history of war. In the Middle Ages, the infantry
imagined that it could not stand against cavalry- and really
it could not. Whole armies of infantry were driven about,
like flocks of sheep, by a few hundred men on horseback .

Till that time, when the continent first beheld the English
infantry, consisting of proud, independent gentry, without
fear, who were not accustomed to yield to any one without a
fight, such an idea was not known. As soon as these people,
who had no tradition that it was necessary to yield to cavalry ,

entered France, the cavalry, which even excelled them in
numbers, was beaten by them at every engagement. You
remember the remarkable victories gained by the small army
of English infantry over the French cavalry at Cressy, at
Poictiers , and at Agincourt. The very same history was
repeated when the Swedish infantry took it into their heads
that they had no reason to look upon themselves as weaker

than the feudal cavalry. The Austrian, and afterwards the
Burgundian , cavalry, superior in numbers, began to suffer
defeats at every engagement ; then all the other cavalry tried
to battle with them, and all of them were defeated.

Then

all said, ' Yes, the infantry seems to be stronger than cavalry . ' Of course it was stronger. But whole centuries have

passed considering that the infantry was weak compared
with cavalry, simply because they looked upon themselves
as weak ."

" Yes , Sasha, this is true . We are weak because we regard ourselves as weak ; but it seems to me that there is

still another cause. I want to speak about myself and you .
Tell me, my dear, did I change much in those two weeks that
you did not see me ? You were too much worried then. It
may have seemed to you more than it really was, or, in fact,
the change was great. How does it seem to you now ? "
" Yes, you really were very thin and pale then."
" Now, you see, my dear, I have learned that this is the

very thing that touches my pride. You see, you love me
very dearly. Why didn't the struggle show itself in you in
such evident signs as it did in me? For nobody saw you become pale or thin in those months when you were separated
from me . How did you bear it so easily?"
" This is why the verses interested you so much, where
Katya overcomes her melancholy by work. You want to
know whether I have experienced the truth of this remark, in

regard to myself. Yes : it is absolutely true. Ikept up the

struggle easily, because I had no time to spend over it. Always, when I paid attention to it, I suffered keenly ; but
every-day necessities compelled me, for the large part of the
time, to forget about it. I had to attend to my patients ; to
get ready for my lectures. At that time, not by my own
will either, I freed myself from my thoughts. Those days
when I had a good many leisure hours I felt that my strength
was failing me. It seems to me that if I had remained a week
a prey to my thoughts, I should have lost my mind. "
" It is so, my dear ; and I at last came to understand that
in this lay the whole secret of the difference between me and
you. You must have such activity that you can postpone it,
that you cannot refuse it ; then a person is incomparably
firmer."

" But you had a great deal of activity then, and the same
thing is true now."
"Akh , Sasha, are they things of such imperative importance ? I devote myself to them as much as I please, and
when I please. Whenever it seems good to me, I can devote
less time to them, or put them off entirely. At a time when

my mind is disturbed, it takes a special effort of the will, and
only in that way can I compel myself to attend to them.
There is no support in the necessity of them.

For example,

I busy myself with my household duties,¹ and I spend a great
deal of time in them ; but nine- tenths of this time I spend in

this way only because I want to. With a good servant,
shouldn't I spend just as much time, even though there was
less necessity to work? And who feels the necessity of
wasting double time for the sake of the slight improvement
over what he, with a less expenditure of time which might
be my own? The only necessity upon me is my own will.
When the mind is at ease, you give yourself up to these
things ; but when your mind is disturbed, you neglect them,
because you can manage without them.

You are apt to give

up the less important for more important things. As soon
as your feelings get greatly stirred up, they drive away the

thoughts about other things.

I give lessons, which are things

of somewhat more importance ; I cannot give them up at the

dictate of my will. But this is not the point. I give them
closer attention at one time than at another ; if during the

lesson my mind wanders somewhat, the lesson may go only
a little worse than before, because teaching is very easy, and

does not absorb the mind. And, after all, do I really make
my living by my lessons ? does my position depend on them ?
do they afford me the principal means for living as I do ?
No ; these means were afforded me by Dmitri's work , now

by yours . Giving lessons flatters my feeling of independence ;
and really they are not unprofitable. Still, there is no vital
necessity upon me for keeping them up. At that time I tried
to drive away my tormenting thoughts by giving myself up
to the shop more than usual ; but again I did it more from
the impulse of my will. You see, I understood that my presence at the shop was needed only for an hour or an hour
and a half ; that if I stayed there longer, I adopt an artificial occupation, that may be useful, but is not indispensable
for the business . And then, again, this very thing, can it
serve as a support for such ordinary mortals as we ? Rakhmétof belongs to a different species. They take hold of common affairs in such a way that the necessity of it fills their
existence ; for them it even forms a substitute for personal
existence. But for us , Sasha, this is unattainable . We are

not eagles, like him ; we can live only in our personal lives .
Is the shop my personal life? This affair is not my affair ,
but others' . I occupy myself with it, not for my own sake,
but for theirs. Let us admit that it is for my own satisfaction ; but can those such as we - not eagles -bother themselves about others when they are themselves in trouble ? Can

they give themselves up to their convictions when they are
tormented by their feelings ? No ; a personal interest, an
unavoidable necessity on which your life depends, is required ;
a necessity which for my own self, for my style of life, my
means of life, for my whole situation in life, for my entire
fate, would be more powerful than all my drawings towards
passion .

Only such a stimulus can serve as a support in

battle with passion ; only such a thing cannot be conquered
by passion, but by itself overwhelms passions ; only such a
thing gives strength and rest. I want such a stimulus."

"You are right, my dear, you are right," said Kirsánof,
kissing his wife, whose eyes were flashing with enthusiasm.
" You are right ; and I never thought of it before, though it
is so evident ; I had not noticed it. Yes, Viérotchka, no one
else can think for another. Whoever wants to enjoy life
must think for himself, look out for himself ; no one else is
going to do it for him. But what necessity do you feel upon
you now ? Are you going to fall in love with some one else,
Viérotchka ? "

ViéraPavlovna laughed heartily, and for some time neither
of them could say a word from laughing .
" Yes , now we both can appreciate that," she said finally .

" Now I can be perfectly sure, and so can you, that nothing
of the sort can possibly happen. But seriously, do you know
how it seems to me, my dear ? If my love for Dmitri was
not the love of a fully developed woman, neither did he love
me in the sense of the word as we understand it.

His feel-

ing for me was a combination of a very warm attachment to
me as a friend, with occasional outbursts of passion towards
me as a woman .

He felt a personal friendship for me, for me

particularly ; but these outbursts were only the attraction
towards woman ; they had no personal relation to me. No,
that was not love. Was he much concerned with thoughts
about me ? No ; they did not interest him. No, on his side ,
as well as on mine, there was no real love ."

" You are unjust to him, Viérotchka."
" No , Sasha ; this is so. In talk between you and me
there is no use in flattering him. Both of us know how highly
we prize him.

We also know that, no matter how he pro-

tested that it was easy for him, in reality it was not easy.
You may also declare that it was an easy matter to struggle
with your passion. All this is well, and it is not put on ; but
such keen assurances must not be taken in the literal sense
of the word . "

" SASHA, let us finish talking about what we left yesterday.
It is necessary ; for I have made up my mind to go with
you : and you must know why," said Viéra Pavlovna, the
next morning.
" With me ?

You are going with me ? "

" Certainly. You asked me, Sasha, why I wanted to do
something on which my life could depend, in real earnest,
which I could hold as dear as you hold your profession ;
which would be just as imperative upon me, which would
demand all my attention, just as yours does you ! My
dear, I must have such a thing, for I am proud. It has
been a burden and a shame upon me for a long time, when
I remembered that my struggle with my feeling reflected
itself upon me so plainly, that it was so unendurable for
me. You know that I do not mean the difficulty of it -

for your struggle was just as hard for you ; that depends
on the strength of the feeling, and I must not be sorry now
that it was very hard, for that would be equivalent to saying
that I was sorry that the feeling was strong. No ! but why
didn't I have as firm a support against its strength as you
had? I want to have such a support. But this only brought
me to think ; but the real necessity is , of course, at the
present time ; and it is this : I want to be your equal in all
things ; that is the main thing. I have found something.
After we parted yesterday, I thought for a long time about
it ; I thought about it all yesterday morning, while you were
away ; and yesterday I wanted to consult you like a good
fellow, but you disappointed my hope by your resistance.
Now it is too late for your advice ; I have already made
up my mind. Yes, Sasha, you will have a great deal of
trouble on account of me . My dear, how happy I shall be if
I find I have the ability for it."
Yes ; now Viéra Pavlovna has found a sphere of activity
in which she could not have succeeded before .

Her Alek-

sandr's hand was always in hers , and so it was easy for her to

go ahead. Lopukhóf placed no restriction upon her, nor did
she upon him ; and that was all. No, of course there was
more ; far more . She was sure, always sure, that in whatever case necessity compelled her to take his hand, his hand
and his life were at her service.

And just as his life was

always at her service, so he would not grudge stretching out
his hand to help her ; that is , in important circumstances ;
in critical moments his hand was as ready and as reliable as

Kirsánof's , and he proved it very satisfactorily by his marriage, when he sacrificed for her sake, all his expectations for
a scientific career, which at that time was so attractive to
him ; and he was not afraid even to run the risk of starvation . Yes ; when there was an important matter, his hand
was ready. But, as a general thing, his hand held aloof

from her. Viéra Pavlovna was starting her sewing union ;
if his aid had been needed for anything, he would have given

at all? He did not interfere ; he approved ; he was glad,
and that was all.
now it is different.

She lived her life ; he lived his . But
Kirsánof did not even wait to be asked

to take part in anything that she was doing. He was as
much interested as she was in all her every-day life, just as
she was in his . It was quite a different relation from that

with her first husband, and so she felt drawn to new activity,
and therefore thoughts arose in her, and began to assume

practical shape, which before were known to her only theoretically, and did not, in reality, touch her inner life ; what it
is impossible to do, you do not think of seriously.

Here follow the thoughts which now stirred in Viéra
Pavlovna's mind, and served as motives to activity.
IX .

" ALMOST all the channels of civilized life are closed to us

by law.¹ A good many are closed to us practically- almost
all paths of public activity even those which are not
closed to us by legal hindrances. Out of all the spheres of
life we are compelled to content ourselves with only one

the sphere of domestic life - to be members of a family ;
and that is all. Besides this, what occupations are open
for us ? Scarcely more than to become governesses ; and
besides , perhaps to give private lessons which men do not
care to deprive us of. There is scarcely room enough for us
in this narrow path ; we interfere with each other, because

too many of us crowd into it ; it scarcely affords us any
independence , because there are too many of us who offer
our services ; not one is needed, for the very reason that we
are too many. Who has any regard for a governess ? If
you merely hint that you want a governess, they flock to
you by the tens and hundreds, each trying to get the place
away from the others .

" No ; as long as women do not strive to branch out in
different ways, women cannot expect to have any independence in life. Of course it is hard to break out a new
path . But my position in this respect is very advantageous ,

and I should be ashamed if I did not avail myself of it. We
are not ready for serious occupations.

I do not know how

far a leader may be needed to prepare for this change. But
I know that to whatever degree I may need his help every
day, he is here at my side. And this will be no burden to
him ; it will be as pleasant to him as to me .
" Custom has shut us out of these paths of independent ac-

tivity which are not closed to us by law. But out of all these
paths from which we are shut by custom, I can select the one

that I want, if I can only make up my mind to meet the
first resistance of custom .

One of them is far more con-

venient to me than the others. My husband is a doctor.
He devotes all his leisure time to me . With such a husband,
it is an easy matter for me to try to be a doctor.

" It would be a very striking thing if there should spring up
at last a class of women doctors They would be very useful
for all women.

It is much easier for a woman to talk with a

woman than with a man. How much suffering, death, and
misfortune would be removed. I must try it." 1
X.

VIERA PAVLOVNA finished her conversation with her hus-

band by putting on her bonnet, and going with him to the
hospital to put her nerves to the test, to find if she could
bear the sight of blood, or be able to study anatomy. With
Kirsánof's position in the hospital, of course there could be
no obstacle to her experiment.

I, without the least sense of shame, have seriously compromised Viéra Pavlovna on the side of sentiment.

For

example, I have not concealed the fact that she dined every
day, and for the most part with good appetite, and, moreover, twice a day drank tea. But I have reached such an
occurrence that, in spite of all the shameless degradation of

my conceptions, I am overtaken by fear ; and I wonder,
would it not be better to hide this thing ? What will be
thought of a woman who gave herself up to medicine ?
What coarse nerves she must have ! What an unfeeling
heart ! She is not a woman, but a butcher. But, considering
that I do not represent the characters of my story as ideals

of perfection , I become calmer.

Let folks judge as they

please about the heartlessness of Viéra Pavlovna's nature .
What business is it of mine ? If she is coarse, let her be
coarse .

And so I say in cold blood that she found a great difference between idle observation of things and active work in
them for her own benefit and the benefit of others .
1 This argument, which is comparatively familiar to the American public, though
even now there is an absurd prejudice in some quarters against women doctors, was
absolutely novel in Russia at the time that this book was written. It gave an immense stimulus to the study of medicine by women. As is well known, all the medi-

cal schools of Europe, especially Switzerland, draw scores of Russian women to their
halls. Viéra Pavlovna was the pioneer.


======================================================================

A VITAL QUESTION.

357

I remember that when I was a boy, twelve years old, I
who had never seen fire was frightened by being wakened by
the loud noise of a fire alarm. The whole sky became red
and fiery ; over all the city, which was a large provincial
town, flew great burning cinders. Over all the city there
was a great tumult, running to and fro, shrieks . I breathed
as though I had been in a fever. Fortunately I succeeded
in getting to the fire, availing myself of the chance that all
the domestics were in a great state of excitement. The fire
was along the shore ; that is, simply the bank, because what
kind of a shore could there be ?

The bank was filled with

wood and with wooden posts. Such boys as I were taking
hold and carrying off things from the burning houses . I
joined them. What became of my fear ? I worked very

energetically till we were told, " That'll do ; the danger is
over " ; and from that time I understood that if you have
any fear of a great fire, you must run to it and work, and
you will not fear at all.
Whoever works has no time to fear, or to feel disgust or
squeamishness. And so Viéra Pavlovna gave herself up to
medicine ; and she was one of the first women whom I knew

to enter this new field of activity. After this she really
began to feel herself a different person. Her thought was ,
" In a few years I shall actually stand on my feet. " This is a
great thought. There can be no full happiness without full

independence .

Poor women, how few among you have this

happiness !
XI.

And thus a year passes ; and another year will pass, and
still another since her marriage to Kirsánof ; and thus all of

Viéra Pavlovna's days will pass as they pass now, a year
after the wedding, as they have passed since the wedding :
and a good many years will pass ; and they will all pass in
this way unless something extraordinary happens. Who
knows what the future will bring forth ? But till the time
that I am writing these lines nothing extraordinary has happened ; and Viéra Pavlovna's days are passing just as they
passed a year or two years after her marriage to Kersánof.
After this terrible compromising circumstance that Viéra

Pavlovna made up her mind to study medicine, and found
herself capable of doing so, I can speak without fear of

A VITAL QUESTION.

everything else ; all that remains cannot injure her so much
in the estimation of the public.

And I must say that now,

on Syergievskaïa Street as before on Vasilyevsky Island,
Viéra Pavlovna's meals were constituted as follows : tea in

the morning, dinner, and tea in the evening . Yes , she has
preserved the unpoetical peculiarities of dining every day,
and taking tea twice a day, and finds it agreeable ; and, generally speaking, she preserves all her unpoetical and ungraceful and far from high-toned peculiarities .

And many other details remain in this new time of contentment just as they were in the former time of contentment ; they kept the rule for the division of the rooms into
neutral and private ; the rule also remained in force that
they should not enter each other's private rooms without permission ; and another, that a question should not be repeated

if the first time it was met by the words, " Do not ask me."
It was agreed between them, that such an answer best allows

no thinking about the question propounded, and that thus it
is more speedily forgotten ; this agreement was made because
they were sure that if it deserved an answer, there would be

need of repeating ; everything would be explained without
the need of asking, and what one keeps silent is surely
nothing interesting. All this was left during this new peaceful time, as it used to be in the old peaceful time, only at
this peaceful time everything has changed to a certain degree,

or rather it has not changed, but yet it is not as it used to
be in the former time ; and their life is different .
For example , there is a strict distinction made between

the neutral and the private rooms, but the permission for
admittance into the private rooms has been decided for good
and all once at a certain hour in the day. This was arranged
because two out of three of their meals were taken each day

in the private rooms . A custom has been made of drinking
morning tea in her room, and evening tea in his room. The

evening tea is conducted without any ceremony ; the old
servant , Stepan, brings into Aleksandr's room the samovar

and the tea service, and that is all. But at morning tea they
arrange it differently. Stepan puts the samovar and the
tea service on the table in that neutral room, which is nearest

Viéra Pavlovna's room, and tells Aleksandr Matvéitch that

the samovar is ready ; that is, he tells Aleksandr Matvéitch
in his room. But supposing he does not find him ? Then
Stepan takes no trouble about finding him ; they must know

for themselves that it is tea-time.

359

And, in accordance with

this custom they made a rule, that in the morning Viéra
Pavlovna expects her husband without asking permission.
After she wakes up she lies comfortably in her warm little
bed ; she is too lazy to rise. She thinks and she does not
think , and she half dreams and she does not dream at all ;

to think means for her to plan something about the day or
the days to come, something about the household,¹ about the
shop, about her acquaintances, about her plans for spending
the day ; this, of course, is not dreaming ; but besides all
this , there are two other objects , and three years after their
marriage still a third appears, which she holds in her arms ;
that is Mitya ; the name Mitya is of course in honor of their
friend Dmitri ; but the two other objects - one was a sweet
thought about her occupation, which is going to give her full
independence of life , and the second thought is Sasha ! This

thought it is impossible to call a special thought, because it
forms the basis of all that she thinks, because he takes part
in all her life, and this thought which is not a special thought
but a constant thought remains alone in her heart. Now you

yourselves see that often the moments pass without Viéra
Pavlovna having time to take a bath. (This was very conveniently arranged ; it cost them a great deal of trouble ; it
was necessary to introduce a faucet into her room, with water
from the kitchen boiler, and to take a great deal of wood for
this luxury ; but, however, they could afford it, and so they
allowed it. ) Yes , very often Viéra Pavlovna has time to
take a bath and to lie down again comfortably until Sasha
should come and take upon himself the duty of attending to
the morning tea.

Yes, it could not be otherwise ; Sasha is perfectly right
when he declared that this must be arranged so because

to drink morning tea, that is, tea mostly made of cream
warmed with a very small dose of very strong tea, and to
drink it in her bed, is wonderfully agreeable . Sasha goes for
the tea service ; yes , this happens oftener than his coming in
directly with the tea service, and he makes himself busy , and
she still takes her ease , and after she drinks the tea she still

reclines , not in her little bed, but on her little sofa . She reclines till ten or eleven o'clock, till Sasha has to leave for the
hospital or the clinic or to his medical lecture , and with his

last cup Sasha takes a cigar, and either one of them reminds

the other, " Now let us go to work" ; or, " That's enough ;
now let us go to work." What work ? Whatever happens lessons or reviews, in Viéra Pavlovna's course of study.
Sasha is her instructor in the study of medicine, but his aid
is still more essential for the preparation of those subjects in

the gymnasium course in which it was necessary for her to
pass the examination, the study of which would be too
tedious by herself ; the most terrible thing of all was mathematics ; yes , the Latin was if anything more tedious ; but it
can't be helped, she must endure the tediousness of it ; not
very long, however. In the examination which serves ir
place of the gymnasium certificate¹ there is very little required in the medical school ; for instance, I cannot guarantee that Viéra Pavlovna will ever reach such a perfection in
the Latin language as to translate two lines of Cornelius
Nepos , but she is already able to explain such phrases as she

finds in medical books , because this knowledge is indispensable, though it is not very deep. No -but we have said
enough about this. I see already that I am irreconcilably
compromising Viéra Pavlovna ; probably, the sapi

CONCERNING

BLUE

STOCKINGS .

" A BLUE STOCKING ! an extreme case of blue stocking !
I can't endure a blue stocking. A blue stocking is dull and

tedious ! " cries the sapient reader, losing his temper, and not
without reason .

After all, what warm friends the sapient reader and I have

become !

He insulted me once ; twice I took him by the

throat and put him out, and yet we cannot help exchanging
our inmost thoughts ; it comes from a secret drawing of heart

to heart. What can you do about it ?
" O sapient reader ! " I say to him, " you are right ; the
blue stocking is really dull and tedious, and it is beyond endurance to put up with him. You have fathomed it ! But
you have not guessed who the blue stocking is ! Now you
shall soon see as plain as in a mirror. The blue stocking,
with an unreasonable affectation , talks with great self- satisfaction about literary and scientific matters of which he does

not know beans, and speaks not because he is interested, but
because he wants to show off wits (which nature never en.
dowed him with) , lofty aspirations (of which he has as much
as the chair on which he is sitting) , and education (of which
he has as much as a parrot) . Do you see whose rough

physiognomy or chastened figure is in the mirror ? 'Tis your
own, my friend ! Yes, no matter how long a beard you may
grow, or how closely shaven you may be, still you are, undoubtedly, indisputably, the original blue stocking, and that
was the reason I twice took you by the throat and put you

out- simply for the reason that I cannot bear blue stockings ,
who among our brethren, the men, are ten times as numerous
as among women.

" And those with a live purpose who occupy themselves
with anything, no matter what, no matter how they may be
dressed, whether they wear a woman's dress or a man's, these
are simply people who attend to their own affairs, and that's
all there is of it ."
XIII .

THE talk about Blue Stockings, so useful for the sapient
reader, who was shown to be one, took me away from my
description of Viéra Pavlovna's manner of spending her
days. Now that when when - whenever you please ;
from the time that she moved from Syergievskaïa Street till
this moment. But however, what is the use of spinning
out this description ? To give a general idea, that change
which began to take place in the way Viéra Pavlovna spent
her evenings , after her renewal of Kirsánof's acquaintance
while she still lived with Vasilyevsky Ostrof, is entirely
developed now that the Kirsánofs, from the centre of a
rather extensive number of young families, living just as
harmoniously and happily as they themselves do, and agreeing with them also in their sentiments , and that music and
singing, the opera and poetry, and all sorts of amusements
and dances , fill all the free evenings of this circle of

families ; because every evening there is some gathering at
one house or another, or some other arrangement for spend-

ing the evening for people of various tastes. As a general
thing, at these gatherings, or whenever any other way of
spending the time is devised, at least half the circle is present, and the Kirsánofs, as well as their friends, spend half

their evenings in this social way. But there is no need of

going into details here ; it is understood, of course. But
there is one thing about which, unfortunately, it is necessary
to be very explicit for the sake of a very large number who
would not otherwise understand.

All of us, even if we have

not ourselves experienced such a thing, but have only read
about it, know how different for a boy or girl is an evening
which is simply a party and an evening on which his dear or
her dear comes to see her or him ; between an opera which

we merely see and an opera which we see sitting next him
or her with whom we are in love. There is a very great
difference. This is well known ; but what is experienced by
very few is that the charm which love gives to everything is
not necessarily, as is common according to the present state
of things , a transitory phenomenon in a person's life ; that
this bright light of life does not necessarily illumine alone
the epoch of searching and attaining , or, let us name the

epoch thus : the epoch of attention, of wooing. No, this
epoch, according to the present state of things, is only the
morning star, gentle, beautiful, but the harbinger of a day
which has incomparably more light and warmth than its
harbinger ; a light and warinth, and particularly a warmth,
which grow more and more even beyond the noon, and still

keeps growing . It used to be different. After the loving
pair were united, quickly the poetry of love vanished. Now,
among those whom we call the people of the present, it is
quite different. They, after being united by love, become
brightened and warmed more and more by the poetry of it the
longer they live together, until late evening, when the care of
growing children may partially divert their thoughts from
themselves . Then care is more sweet than personal enjoyment ; it becomes more absorbing , but till that time it keeps

on growing . What people used to know as honeymoons,
the people of the present generation keep for long years .
Why is this so ? This is a secret ; I may tell you though.
It is a grand secret ; it is good to avail oneself of it, and it
does not take great skill to do so . All that is required is a

pure heart and an honest soul, and the present idea of the
rights of a human being with regard to the freedom of the
one with whom you live. That is all. There is no further
secret about it. Look upon your wife as you looked upon
your bride ; know that she has the right to tell you any

moment, " I am dissatisfied with you ; leave me."

Look

upon her so, and nine years after your marriage she will
inspire in you the same poetical feeling as she did when she
was a bride - no , more poetical, more ideal, in the proper
sense of the word. Acknowledge her liberty as openly and
formally and without any circumlocutions, just as you
acknowledge the freedom of your friends, to feel or not
to feel friendship towards you, and then in ten years, in
twenty years , after your wedding, you will be as much in
love with her as when you were a bridegroom. So live husbands and wives of the new dispensation .

It is much to be

desired. And for that very reason, that they are honest
towards each other, they love each other ten years after
marriage more warmly and poetically than on the weddingday, and just for the very reason that during these ten years
neither he nor she gave each other a dissembling kiss or
said one hypocritical word. " A lie has never passed his
lips," was said about somebody in a certain book ; " There is
no hypocrisy in his heart " was said about somebody, maybe
in the very same book. They read the book and think,
"What a wonderful moral height is ascribed to him ! "
When they wrote the book they thought, " Here we are

describing a man who will fill every one with surprise."
They know not who wrote the book, do not realize who is
going to read it ; but the people of the new dispensation
do not receive among the number of their acquaintances
anybody who does not possess such a soul, and they have no

lack of such a soul, and they have no lack of such acquaintance, and they look upon their acquaintances as nothing

more than people of the new dispensation, good, but ordinary people .

One thing calls for pity : at the present time, to every one
man of the new dispensation there are a dozen or more
antediluvians . This , however, is natural. In an antediluvian

world you expect an antediluvian population.
XIV .

" AND So here we have been living together three years
(before, it used to be said a year, two years, and later it will
be said four years, and so on), " and yet we are still like

lovers, who see each other rarely and secretly. Where did
people get the idea that love grows weak, when there is

nothing to hinder people from belonging wholly to each
other ? These people did not know true love. They felt
only an erotic selfishness , or an erotic fancy. Real love
begins only when people begin to live together."
" Do you notice that in me ? "

" I notice in you something that is much more interesting.
In three years you will forget that you have studied medicine,
and in three years you will forget to read, and from all your
senses , which are needful for intellectual life, you will use
only one, - that of sight ; and sight, too, will forget to see
anything else but me ."

Such conversations do not last long, and are not frequent ;
but still, occasionally, they have such conversations.
" Yes , it grows stronger every year. "
" In the nature of man does attachment grow weaker ?
does it fail to be developed by time ? When does friendship
become stronger and firmer ? in a week, or a year, or twenty
years after it began? It is only necessary
ssary that people should
choose the right friends ; that they should be suited to each
other ."

These conversations take place, but they are not frequent.
They are brief, and not frequent.

In fact, what reason

have they to talk about this subject very often ?
But this kind come oftener and last longer : " Sasha, how greatly your love supports me ! Through it
I am becoming independent ; I am getting rid of all dependence upon anybody, even upon you. But what has my love
brought to you ? "
" For me ? not less than for you ! It is a constant,
powerful, healthy stimulus of the nerves ; it essentially
develops the nervous system ! " ( " Coarse materialism ! "
declare the sapient reader and I together.) " And therefore the intellectual and moral strength grow in me from my
love."

" Yes, Sasha, I hear from everybody - I myself am a
bad witness in the case ; my eyes are blinded - but everybody sees the same thing ; your eyes are growing brighter,
your views become clearer and keener. "
" Viérotchka, why should I praise or not praise myself
before you ? We are one. But this must really be reflected
in the eyes .

My mind has become far stronger ; when I make

conclusions from observations, or a general examination of

the facts, I finish now in an hour what used to take me

several hours. And I can grasp with my mind many more
facts than before, and the conclusions drawn from them are

broader and fuller. Viérotchka, if I had the slightest germ
of genius with this feeling, I should become a great genius.
If I had been endowed by nature with the power of creating
something new in science, with this feeling I should have the
power of reorganizing science.

But I was born merely to

be a rough laborer, a swarthy little toiler, who works over
little special questions. Such I was before I knew you ;
now you know I am different. More is expected of me ; it
is supposed that I am going to reorganize the most important
branch of science, the whole teaching about the functions of
the nervous system ; and I feel that I am going to fulfil this
expectation .

At the age of twenty-four a man's views are

wider and bolder and more original, than when he reaches
the age of twenty-nine, and the same is true at the age of

thirty and thirty-two, and so on ; but then it was not true of
me as it is now, and I feel that I am still progressing, while
without you I should long ago have ceased to grow. Yes,

and I did cease to grow the last two or three years before
we began to live together.

You brought back to me the

freshness of my early youth, the power of going vastly
further than where I should have stopped, if it had not been
for you. And the energy of work, Viérotchka, does that
signify little ! An immense stimulus of strength is brought
into labor when your whole life is so inclined.

You know

how the energy of intellectual labor is simulated by a glass
of coffee ; what they afford others for an hour after, which
follows a reaction proportionate to these outward and transi-

tory stimuli, this I find constantly ; my nerves are constantly attuned to finer, more vital energies." (" Again
coarse materialism ! " we remark, etc.)
These conversations are more frequent and longer.
" He who has not experienced how love stimulates all the
powers of a man knows not what real love is .”

" Love consists in elevating others, and in being elevated."
" He who has no stimulus to activity without it finds such
stimulus in love ; and if a man has a stimulus, love gives
him strength to use it to advantage ."

" Only he loves who helps a lovely woman to rise to independence."

" Only he loves whose mind grows brighter and hands
grow stronger from love."
And the following conversations are very frequent : -

" My dear, I am reading Boccaccio now " ( " What immorality ! " we remark with the sapient reader - " a woman read-

ing Boccaccio; only he and I have a right to read it. " But I,
apart from him, also make this remark, " A woman will hear
more veiled nastiness from the sapient reader in five minutes
than she will find in all Boccaccio, and she will not hear from

him a single fresh, bright, pure thought, while Boccaccio has
hosts of them ! ") ; " you are right, my dear ; he has great talent.

Some of his stories I think can be put in the same

rank with the best of Shakespeare's dramas, from their depth
and keenness of psychological analysis."
" But how do you like the comical stories, in which he is
so unceremonious ? "

" Some of them are amusing, but for the most part they
are dull, like any other coarse farce."
" But that may be forgiven him, for he lived five hundred

years before us ; what seems to us too vile, too cheap, was
not then considered out of the way."

" Just as all our habits and all our style will seem dirty to
those who will live much less than five hundred years after us but this is not interesting. I was speaking about those splendid
stories of his in which he seriously pictures a passionate, lofty
love. In those more than in others his talent lies ; but this is

what I wanted to say, Sasha: he draws very admirable and
powerful pictures of love, but I should judge that he did not
understand that tenderness of love which we see nowadays .

Love was not felt at that time so keenly, though they say
that was the period when love was most fully enjoyed. No,
how could it be? They did not enjoy it half so deeply as
we do. Their feelings were too superficial ; their raptures
were too feeble and too transitory."

" The strength of sensation is proportionate to the depth
of the organism from which it takes its rise.

If it is

stirred exclusively by an outward object, by an outward
motive, then it is transitory , and develops only one special

side of its life. He who drinks only because he is given a
glass understands only very little the taste of wine ; it

affords him very little pleasure.

Little birds are flying from twig to twig, and

a whispering undertone, laughter, and a secret, silent pressing of hands, and now and then a stealthy, inaudible kiss.
" A song ! a song ! without song joy is not complete ! " And
the poet rises . His face and mind are lighted by inspiration ; nature whispers to her secrets ; history reveals her significance ; and the life of thousands of years passes by in his
song like a series of pictures .
1.

The poet's words resound, and a picture appears .
The tents of nomads . Around the tents are grazing sheep,
horses , camels. Afar lies the forest, olives, and fig-trees .
Still further, further, at the edge of the horizon, towards the
north -west , is a double chain of lofty mountains. The summits of the mountains are covered with snow ; their slopes

are covered with cedars. But the shepherds are straighter
than the cedars ; their wives are straighter than the palmtrees , and their days are free from care in this soft, idle
existence .

They have one concern , - love ; all their lives

pass, day by day, in caresses and songs of love.
" No," says the shining one ; " this is not about me ; I
did not exist then.

Yonder woman was a slave .

Where

there is no equality I am not found. That tsaritsa was
Astarte . Lo, there she is ! "
A beautiful woman. On her hands and feet are heavy

golden bracelets ; a heavy necklace of pearls and corals with
golden links upon her neck.

Her hair is moistened with

myrrh. Her face betrays sensuality and servility. Her eyes
are full of voluptuousness and insipidity .

" Be obedient to thy lord ; sweeten his idleness during the
intervals of his forays ; thou must love him because he
bought thee ; and if thou dost not love him, he will kill thee,"
says she to a woman who lies before her in the dust.

" Thou seest that it is not I," says the beauty.
2.

Again resound the inspired words of the poet. A new
picture arises :
A city. At the distance, towards the north and east, are
the mountains ; towards the east and south, and further to

the west, the sea. A wonderful city. The houses there aro

small , mean in their outward show. But how many wonderful temples are there ! especially on the hill, where the steps ,
with gates of wondrous grandeur, lead. The whole height
is filled with temples and public edifices, any one of which
alone would now be sufficient to increase the glory and fame
of the finest of our capitals .

Thousands of statues decorate

these temples and the city everywhere, - statues, one of
which alone would be sufficient to make the museum where

it was placed the first museum of the world. And how beau-

tiful the people are, as they come crowding into the squares ,
into the streets ! Each of these young youths , each of these
young girls, could serve as a model for a statue. Indeed, it
is an active, lively, joyous people, a people whose life is
bright and beautiful. These houses , which are not luxurious
to look upon, what riches of beauty and lofty power of enjoyment they show within ! With everything of furnishing

or household ware one might fall in love. And all these
people are so beautiful ; they have such solid understanding
of beauty ; they live for love ; they serve the beautiful.
Here comes an exile back to the city whose power he destroyed ; he returns to rule, and all know it.

Why is not

one hand raised against him ? On the chariot with him goes
awoman of marvellous beauty, even in a city of beautiful
women, pointing him to the people, begging the people to
accept him, assuring the people that she supports him. And
bowing low before her beauty, the people entrust their fate
to Peisistratos, their favorite. Here is a court ; the judges
are stern old men, -the people may be drawn away, but
they yield not to impulses. The Areopagos is famous for
its merciless severity, by its implacable honesty. Gods and
goddesses came before it to ask decision in their cases. And
here a woman must appear before them, whom all consider
guilty of horrible crimes ; she must die, the destroyer of
Athens ; each of the judges has already decided in his soul ;
Aspasia appears before them, she who is doomed, and they
all kneel down before her on the earth, and they say, " Thou
shalt not be judged.

Thou art too beautiful.

Isn't this the

kingdom of beauty ? isn't this the kingdom of love ? "
" No," says the radiant one ; " at that time I was not in

existence. They bowed to a woman, but they did not consider her their equal. They subjected themselves to her
only as to a source of enjoyment ; human dignity they did
not acknowledge in her. Where respect to awoman is not

was called Aphrodite. Here she is ."

That tsaritsa

That tsaritsa has no adornments whatsoever.

She is so

beautiful that her admirers did not wish her to wear any
dress .

Her wonderful lines must not be hidden from de-

lighted eyes .

What does she say to a woman who is almost as beautiful
as she is, who throws frankincense upon her altars ?
" Be a source of enjoyment for mankind. He is thy
master.

Thou livest not for thyself, but for him."

And in her eyes there is only the tenderness of physical
enjoyment. Her bearing is haughty ; in her face there is
pride, but pride only in its physical beauty. And to what a
life a woman was doomed during her reign ! Man locked
his wife in the gynecium, so that no one but him, her master,
might enjoy her beauty, which belonged to him alone. She
had no liberty.

There were other women who called them-

selves free, but they sold the enjoyment of their beauty,
they sold their liberty. No, they had no liberty. This
saritsa was half a slave. Where there is no liberty there
is no happiness , there I am not found.
3.

Again resound the poet's words. A new picture appears :

Before the castle, an arena. Around is an amphitheatre,
with a shining host of spectators. On the arena are knights .
Over the arena, on the balcony of the castle, sits a maiden.
She has her scarf in her hands .

Whosoever conquers shall

get the scarf and the kiss of her hand. The knights fight to
the death. Toggenburg is victorious. " Knight, I love
thee like a sister. Ask no other sort of love. My heart
does not beat faster when you come ; it beats not faster

when you depart. My fate is decided," says he, and departs for Palestine. And throughout all Christendom the
glory of his doughty deeds is spread. But he cannot live
without seeing the tsaritsa of his soul. He returns ; he has
not found forgetfulness in battles . " Do not rap at the

door, O knight ; she is now in the nunnery."

He builds for

himself a little hut, from the window of which, unseen by

her, he can see her when she opens the window of her cell.
And all his life is one longing for her to appear at the win.

dow, beautiful as the sun. He has no other life than to see
the tsaritsa of his soul. There was no other life in life, for

life was dead in him ; and as life was ebbing away, he sat
still at the window of his hut and thought one thought alone,
" Shall I ever see her again ? "

" This is not all about me," says the radiant one. " He
loved her as long as he did not touch her. If she had
become his wife , she would have become his slave ; she would

have been obliged to tremble before him ; he would have
locked her up ; he would have ceased to love her. He would

have gone out hunting ; he would have gone to the war ; he
would have caroused with his comrades ; he would have
seduced the daughters of his vassals ; his wife would have

been cast aside, locked up, despised. When once a man
had enjoyed a woman, then he ceased to love her from that
time forth.

Modest, humble, tender, beautiful, - more beautiful than
Astarte ; more beautiful than Aphrodite herself, but melan-

choly, gloomy, sorrowful. Before her they bowed their
knees ; they bring her bouquets of roses . She says :
" My soul is sad with deathly sorrow. A dagger is
plunged into my heart. Be ye also sorrowful. Ye are
unfortunate .

The earth is a vale of sorrow ."

" No, no ! I was not in existence then," says the radiant
one.

4.

" No, those tsaritsas did not resemble me. They are all
still reigning, but the kingdoms are crumbling. With the
birth of each of them the reign of her predecessor began to

crumble. I was born only when the kingdom of the last
began to crumble. And since I was born, their kingdom
began to crumble more rapidly ; and soon they will vanish
entirely ; the successor of each could not take the place left

by the others, since the others still existed. I shall take the
place of all of them; they shall vanish ; I shall remain the
mistress of the world. But they had to reign before me ;
without their reign, mine could not come.

beasts when man began to value the beauty of woman. But

took unto himself that wife, whose beauty he began to value.
She became his property, his chattel. That was Astarte's
reign.

" When he became further developed, he began to value
her beauty more than before, and he began to worship her
beauty.

But her conscience was not yet developed.

He

valued in her only beauty. She could get her ideas from
him alone. He said he only was a man, while she was not.
She saw in herself only a beautiful, beautiful object, belonging to him ; she did not look upon her as belonging to
humanity. That was the reign of Aphrodite.
" But here the consciousness that she , too, was a human

being, began to awake in her. What grief must have seized
her at the very faintest appearance of this thought, that she
was an independent human being !

For she was not recog-

nized as such. A man did not want her in any other relation than that of slave.

And she said, ' I do not want to

be your friend on this condition.' Then his passion compelled him to implore her and to humiliate himself, and he
forgot that he did not look upon her as a human being, and
he loved her, the resistant, the unapproachable, the virtuous
maiden. But as soon as she put trust in his prayers, as soon
as he touched her, - woe to her ! She was in his clutches ;
his hands were stronger than her hands , and he made her his
slave , and despised her. Woe to her ! This was the sorrowful reign of the virgin .

" But ages past : my sister - dost thou know her ? The
one that before I appeared, did her work for thee. She
always existed, she was before all, she was in existence as

soon as man came upon earth, and she always worked untiringly. Hard was her task, slow her success , but she
worked, worked, and her success increased. Man became
more rational, woman more and more firmly recognized her
equality with man, and the time came when I was born.

" This was not long ago ; Oh, far from long ago. Do you
know who first recognized that I was born, and told it to
others ? It was Rousseau, in his ' Nouvelle Eloïse.' From

it, from him, people for the first time heard of me.
" Since then my kingdom has been spreading. But I am
not yet tsaritsa over many. But it spreads rapidly, and you
can foresee the time when I shall reign over all the earth.

Only then people will perfectly appreciate how beautiful I
am. Now, those who acknowledge my power, are not yet

posed to all my will. The throng would tear them in pieces ,
would poison their lives, if they confessed and fulfilled my
will. And I must have happiness ; I desire that there should
be no suffering, and I tell them, ' Don't do that which will
bring torment upon you ; fulfil my will only so far as it will
not cause yourselves harm. ”
" But can I know thee perfectly ? "
" Yes, thou canst. Thy position is very fortunate. Thou
hast naught to fear.

Thou canst do whatsoe'er thou pleas-

est ; and if thou wishest to know all my will, from my will
no harm will come to thee : thou must not desire, and thou
wilt not desire, anything on account of which ignorant people

may torment thee. Thou art now perfectly content with
what thou hast. Thou dost not desire, and thou wilt not
desire, anything or anybody else. I can declare myself to
thee entirely."
" Reveal to me thy name ; thou hast told me the names of
the former tsaritsas, but thy own name thou hast never
declared to me ."

" Dost thou want me to tell thee my name? Look at me,
hearken to me."
5.

" Look at me, hearken to me ! Dost thou recognize my
voice ? Dost thou know my face ? Hast thou ever seen my
face ? "

No ; she had never seen her face, had ne'er seen it in her
life. Yet how did it seem to her as though she had seen it ?

It is a year since she was speaking with him, since he looked
upon her , kissed her, and now she sees her so often , this

radiant beauty ; and the radiant one does not hide from her,
neither does she hide from him ; she appears to her in all
her radiant beauty.
" No , I have never seen thee ; I have never seen thy face :
thou didst appear to me ; I saw thee ; but thou wert girt with

brightness . I could not see thee ; I only saw that thou wert
more beautiful than all. Thy voice, I hear it, but I hear
only that thy voice is more beautiful than all."
" Look ; for thy sake at this moment, I shall diminish the
brightness of my aureole, and my voice shall sound for thee
at this moment without the enchanting power which I always lend to it ; for one moment I cease to be a tsaritsa.


======================================================================

Hast thou seen ? hast thou heard ? hast thou learned ?

375
That

will suffice ; again am I tsaritsa, and tsaritsa I shall be for
all time to come ."

She was again girt about with the ineffable brightness of
her halo, and again her voice is inexpressibly intoxicating.
But for that moment when she ceased to be the tsaritsa, so

as to declare herself unto thee, was it really so ? Did Viéra
Pavlovna really see this countenance ? really hear this voice ?
" Yes , " says the tsarita, " thou hast wanted to know who
I am ; now thou knowest. Thou hast wanted to hear my
name ; I have no name different from the one to whom I
appear ; my name is her name . Thou hast seen who I am .

No, there is nothing loftier than man ; there is nothing loftier
than woman . I am the one to whom I appear, who loves
and is loved ."

Yes , Viéra Pavlovna saw. It was herself ; it was herself,
but a goddess . The goddess' countenance is her own coun-

tenance, her living countenance, the features of which are so
far from perfection ; every day she sees more than one face
more beautiful than hers. This was her own face, kindled with
the brightness of love ; more beautiful than all ideals left to

us by sculptors of the ancient time, and by the great artists
of the great age of art. Yes, it is she herself, but kindled
by the brightness of life ; it is she, more beautiful than whom
are hundreds of faces in Petersburg, which is so poor in
beauty. She is more beautiful than the Aphrodite of the
Louvre, more beautiful than all the beauties of the past .
" Thou seest thyself in the mirror just as thou art without
me. In me thou seest thyselfjust as the one who loves thee,
sees thee . For his sake thou and I art one ; for him there

is no one more beautiful than thou ; for him all ideals grow
obscure in thy presence. Is it not so ? "
" Yes ! oh , yes ! "
6.

" Now, thou knowest who I am ; know what I am. I

have all the enjoyment of sense which Astarte had ; she is
the original mother¹ of all of the rest of us tsaritsas who succeeded her . I have the rapture at the sight of beauty no less

than Aphrodite had ; I have the reverence for purity which
Chastity ' possessed .
1 Rodonatchálnitsa .


======================================================================

376

A VITAL QUESTION.

" But in me it is not as it was in them, but fuller, loftier,

keener. The virtue possessed by Chastity' is combined in
me with the quality which distinguished Astarte and that
which distinguished Aphrodite. And while I combine in me
these other powers, each of them becomes greater and better

from the union. But more, far more power is given to each
of these qualities by that new power which I have, and which

none of the former tsaritsas had.

This new power in me

serves to distinguish me from them ,

the equal rights of

those who love, equality in the relations between them as
men , - and from this new power it comes that there is far
more beauty in me than in them .

" When a man recognizes the equal rights of a woman with
himself, he ceases to regard her as his personal property.

Then she loves him as he loves her, only because she wants
to love ; but if she does not want to love, he has no right
over her, as she has none over him. Therefore in me is
freedom .

"Aside from equal rights and freedom, all that in me,

which was also possessed by the former tsaritsas, gets a new
character, a loftier charm, a charm which had not been known

until I appeared, and in comparison with which all else which
was known till I came is nothing.
" Till I appeared, people had no idea of perfect enjoyment of freedom , because , without free inclinations on both

sides , no one who loves can have a keen rapture. Till
I appeared, people had no idea of the full enjoyment in the
contemplation of beauty, because if beauty is revealed not
by a free inclination, there can be no keen rapture in its
contemplation . Without free inclination, both enjoyment and
rapture are dull, in comparison with what they are in me .

My chastity is purer than that ' Chastity ' which spoke only
of the purity of the body; I possess purity of heart. I am
free, because there is no deceit in me, no hypocrisy. I shall
say not a word which does not express what I feel ; I shall
give no kiss which is not from the heart.

But all that which

is new in me, which gives a loftier charm to all that was in
the former tsaritsas , that in itself constitutes in me a charm
which is loftier than all else .

A master is embarrassed before

his servant ; a servant before his master. Only in the presence of his equals is a man entirely at his ease.

With a

lower nature one feels dull ; only with an equal is there happiness. Therefore, till I appeared, man did not know full

happiness or love. All that he felt before I came is not
worthy of being called happiness ; it was only a momentary
excitement. And woman ! how pitiful woman was before I
appeared ! She was then an abject, servile person. She
was in fear; until I came, she knew too little what love is .
Where there is fear there can be no love .

" Therefore, if you want to express in one word what I
am, this word is " Equal Rights." Without it enjoyment of
the body, delight in beauty, are tedious. gloomy, wretched ;
without it there is no purity of heart ; there is fallacious pur-

ity of body.

From it, as from equality, originates my free-

dom, without which I were not.

" I have told all things to thee, and thou canst tell them

to others , all things that I am now. But my kingdom now
is small. I must guard those who are under my allegiance
from the slander of those who do not know me ; I cannot yet

express all my will to all people, to all men. I shall express
it to all, when my kingdom shall embrace all men, when all
men shall be beautiful in body and pure in heart. Then I
shall show them all my beauty . But thou ! thy fate is specially fortunate. I shall not disturb thee, I shall not harm
thee, by telling thee what I shall be when not a few, as now,

but all, shall be worthy of recognizing me as their tsaritsa.
To thee alone I shall tell the secrets of my fortune. Swear
that thou will be silent, and listen ."

what she makes me ; but she is working for me. Sister, come
to my aid."

The sister of her sisters, the bride of her bridegrooms .
"Good morning, sister," she says to the tsaritsa. “ Thou ,
too, art here , sister ? " she says to Viéra Pavlovna. " Thou
wishest to see how men are going to live when this adopted
1saritsa of mine shall reign over all. Behold ! "
An edifice ; an enormous, enormous edifice, such as can

be seen only in the largest capitals - or, no, at the present
time there is none such in the world.

It stands amid fields

of grain, meadows , gardens , and groves. The fields of
grain this is our grain - they are not such as we have
now, but rich, rich, abundant, abundant.

Is it wheat ?

Who ever saw such heads ? Who ever saw such grain ?
Only in forcing-houses is it possible to make such heads
of wheat, such royal grain !

The meadows are our mead-

ows ; but such flowers as these are now found only in
flower-gardens . Orchards are full of lemon-trees, oranges ,
peaches , and apricots. How can they grow in the open air ?
O yes, there are columns around them ; they are opened in
summer ; yes , these orangeries are opened for the summer.
Groves ; these are our groves

oak and linden, maple and

elm; yes , just the same groves as now. Very great care
is taken of them . There are sickly trees among them, but
the groves are the same : they are the same trees as now .
But this edifice ! what is it ? what style of architecture ?

There is nothing like it now ; no, but there is one that points
toward it,
the palace which stands on Sydenham Hill, built
of cast- iron and glass
cast-iron and glass, and that is all.

No, not all ; that is only the integument of an edifice, -the
outside walls. But inside of this palace is a real house , a tremendous house ! This integument of cast-iron and glass only

covers it as by a sheath ; it forms around it wide galleries on
all the floors. How simple is the architecture of the inward
house !

What narrow spaces between the windows ! and the

windows are huge and lofty, the whole height from floor to
floor ; its stone walls , like rows of pilasters , forming the frame
for the windows which open out into the galleries. But what
floors and ceilings these are ! What are these doors and
window- frames made of ? What is it ? Silver ? Platinum ?
And the furniture is almost all of the same metal ; wooden

furniture is little more than a caprice here- only for the sake

of variety.

379

But what are all the rest of the furniture, the

ceilings and floors, made of ? " Try to move this chair," says
the elder sister. “ This metallic furniture is lighter than ours
made of walnut.

But what is this metal ?

Akh ! I know

now . Sasha showed me a little board like this ; it was light,
like glass ; and now ear-rings and brooches are made out of it.
Yes , Sasha said that sooner or later aluminum would take the

place of wood, or maybe even of stone. But how rich every-

thing is ! Everywhere is aluminum and aluminum, and all
the spaces between the windows are adorned by large mirrors . And what carpets on the floors ! Here in this parlor

half of the floor is bare, and so you can see that it is made of
aluminum. Here you see that it is unpolished, lest it should
be too slippery. Here children are playing, and together
with them their elders ; and here in this other hall the floor

is also bare, for the dancers.

And everywhere are tropical

trees and flowers ; the whole house is a large winter garden. "
But who lives in this house which is more magnificent than

palaces ? " Here live many, very many. Come, we will see."
They go to the balcony which corresponds with the upper
floor of the gallery. How is it that Viéra Pavlovna did not
notice it before ? On these fields groups of people are scattered ; men and women everywhere, young folks and old together ; but the majority are young ; a few old men, still less
old women ; there are more children than old men, but still

few. More than half the children are indoors , attending to
the housework. They do almost everything in the house ;
they like it very much. There are a few old women with
them ; but there are few old men and old women here, be-

cause here they grow old very late.

" Here is a healthful

and peaceful life ; it preserves the freshness . "

The groups which are working in the fields are almost all
singing. What work are they doing ? Akh, it is harvesttime. They are getting in the grain. How quick the work
goes on !

But how can it help going on quickly, and how

can they help singing ? Almost all the work is done by machines, which are reaping and binding the sheaves, and carrying them away. The men have scarcely more to do than
look on, drive and manage the machines, and how well everything is arranged for themselves !

It is a hot day, but they

of course don't mind it. Over that part of the field where
they are working is stretched a huge awning ; as the work
advances, this also moves . What a fine shadow they have

manufactured !
How can they help working quickly and
gayly? How can they help singing? In such a way I too
would become a harvest hand. And all songs, all songs ,
unfamiliar ones, new ones ; and here they have remembered
ours also : I know it : -

" We shall live with thee like nobles ;
All these people are our friends ;

Whatsoe'er thy soul desireth,
We shall all attain our ends ." 1

But here the work is done, and all go to the edifice.
" Let us again go into the hall ; let us see how they will
dine," says the elder sister. They enter the very largest of
the mighty halls. Half of it is occupied with tables ; the
tables are already laid - how many of them there are ! How
many people are going to dine here !

Yes, a thousand or

more : not all are, for those who please dine privately."
The old women, the old men, and the children who did not

go out into the field got all this ready. " To cook the
meals , to keep the house in order, to clean the rooms, this is
very easy work for other hands," says the other sister.
" Those who are not able to do anything else must do this."
What magnificent dishes ! All of aluminum and glass.
On the middle aisle are vases of flowers .

The dishes are

already on the table ; the workingmen have come ; all sit
down at the table, both they and those who got ready the
dinner .

But who will be the

waiters ?

" When ?

At

dinner-time ? Why ? There are only five courses : those
which must be kept hot are placed where they will not get
cold. Do you see these recesses ? These are pans filled
with boiling water," says the elder sister. " You live
comfortably, you like a good table ; do you often have such
a dinner as this ? " " Several times a year. This is an
every-day dinner with these people ; whoever pleases has a
better one, with whatever he may prefer. But then a different account is kept, and whoever does not ask for anything
beyond what the rest have, no special account is kept, and
all is arranged this way: all which the whole company
can afford to enjoy is given without special accounts , but
for every special thing or luxury a special account is kept."

friends to us; whateverto thy soul is pleasant I shall attain it all with them.

" The flowers have wilted, and the leaves begin to fall from

the trees ; the picture grows gloomy ; it would be too melancholy to look upon; here it would be gloomy to live," says
the elder sister. “ I do not like it. The halls are deserted ;
there is no one in the fields," says the elder sister. “ I have

arranged this according to my sister, the tsaritsa's desire. "
" Is the palace really deserted ? "

" Yes, it is cold and damp here. Here, out of two thousand people, only ten or twenty of those originals for whom
it seemed a pleasant variety to remain here for the present,
in this solitude, in seclusion, to look at the northern autumn.

After some time during the winter there will be constant
change : small parties will come - lovers of winter sports to spend several days here in winter fashion."
" But where are they now ? "
" Everywhere that is warm and comfortable," says the
elder sister.

" In summer when there is much work here

and it is pleasant, many different guests come here from the
south ; we were in the house when the whole company con-

sisted of guests like you ; but a good many houses are built
for the guests in other places ; and the guests belonging to

different nations and the housekeepers live together, each
one selecting the company which best pleases him. But

the work , you , yourself, during seven or eight bad months of
your year, leave for the south wherever you please. But
you have in the south a special portion where the main
portion of you live. That part is called New Russia."
" Is that Odessa and Kherson ? "

"That is in your time ; but behold where the New
Russia is .”

Mountains clad in gardens ; amid the mountains narrow
ravines , wide valleys . " These mountains used to be naked

crags ," says the elder sister. " Now they are covered with
a thick layer of earth, and often amid the garden grow copses
of lofty trees, beneath which, on the damp hollows, are plantations of coffee-trees ; higher up, date-palms, fig-trees, vineyards mingled with plantations of sugarcane ; in the fields
grow wheat, but there is more of rice."
" What land is this ? "

" Let us for a moment rise a little higher, and you shall
see that it is boundless."

Far to the northwest are wide

rivers , which unite and flow towards those eastern and

southern places from which Viéra Pavlovna is looking.
Farther, in that same southeasterly direction, she sees long,
wide bays ; on the south the land stretches far away between
these bays , and the long, narrow sea which forms its western
boundary. Between the narrow bays and the sea, which
opens out towards the west is a narrow isthmus.

" But we

are in the centre of the desert," says the astonished Viéra
Pavlovna .

" Yes , the centre of what used to be a desert, but now ,

as you see, everything has been changed, all the space from
the Green River on the northeast has been turned into a fer-

tile land, just as it was in olden times ; and again it has become that zone, extending to the north, which in olden times
was said to overflow with milk and honey . '

" We are not very far, as you see, from the southern
boundary of the cultivated land ; the mountainous part of
the peninsula remains , as yet, a sandy, fruitless steppe, such

as, in your day, the whole peninsula used to be. Every
year the people, you Russians, are pushing away the boundary of the desert to the south ; others are working in other
lands ; all have sufficient room, and enough to do to live
comfortably and abundantly ; yes , from the great northeastern rivers. All the region towards the south, till you

come to the great peninsula, is green, and full of flowers ;
over the whole region stand built grand palaces, as in the
north, three versts apart, like numberless, great chessmen
on a mighty chessboard. Let us descend to one of them,"
says the elder sister.

The same kind of grand crystal house, but its columns are
white.

" They are made of aluminum," says the elder sister ;
" because it is hot here, and white becomes less heated in the
sun ; it is somewhat dearer than cast-iron, but it is better
suited to the climate ."

But besides, they have devised this plan : at a long distance, around the crystal palace, are placed rows of lofty,
thin pillars, and upon them, high over the palace, over the
whole dvor, and for half a verst around it is stretched a
white awning .

" It is kept ever moistened with water," says the elder
sister ; " you see from every column a little fountain rises
higher than the awning, and scatters its drops around, and
therefore it is comfortable to live here for the varying temperature to suit themselves ."
" But who likes heat and the bright southern sun ? ”
" You see at a distance there are tents and pavilions ;

every one can live as he pleases : I lead the world, and I
work with no other end in view."
" So these cities remain for those who like cities ? "

" Such people are few.

There are less towns than before

-almost only those which on the best harbors are needed
as centres of communication, and the interchange of commodities with other centres of exchange. But these cities
are larger and more beautiful than the former ; people go

there sometimes for recreation ; the greater part of the inhabitants are all the time changing, and they remain there
for work but a short time ."

" But who wants to live there constantly ? "

" They live just as you do in your Petersburgs, Parises ,
Londons .

Whose affair is that ?

Who is to interfere ?

Let

everybody live as he pleases ; but the greatest majority,
ninety-nine out of every hundred, live just as I and my sister have showed you, because it is more pleasant, and more

profitable to them. But go into the palace ; it is quite late ;
it is time to see them."


======================================================================

" But no, first I want to know how this happened."
" What ? "

" That a fruitless desert became a most fruitful land, where

almost all of us spend two-thirds of our year. "
" How this happened? Is there anything miraculous in
it ? This happened not in the course of one year, not in
ten ; they have been bringing it about gradually. They
brought clay from north-east, from the shores of the great
river ; from the north-west, from the shores of the great sea.

They possess a great number of such powerful machines :
the clay solidified the sand ; they constructed canals ; they
arranged for irrigation ; verdure made its appearance ; the atmosphere became more moist ; the work went forward step by

step, for many versts , but sometimes only a verst ayear, just as
they are going towards the south ; is there anything miraculous
in this ? They only became intelligent ; they used for their
own advancement a great many powers and expedients
which had been expended before without utility or directly
for their injury. It is not in vain that I am laboring and
teaching. It was only hard for people to learn what was
useful ; they were in your time such savages, such ruffians ,
such barbarians, such idiots, but I kept on teaching them,
teaching them ; and as soon as they began to comprehend,
then it was not hard to fulfil my teachings.

I demand noth-

ing difficult ; you know it. You are doing some for my
sake in my method, even now ; is it difficult ? "
" No."

" Of course not. Remember your shop, your sewing
union. Did you have great means ? Did you have more
than others ? "
" No ; what means did we have ? "

" And yet your seamstresses have tenfold more conveniences, twenty-fold more happiness in life, and they experience a hundred-fold less unpleasantness than others with
such small means as you had. You yourself have proved

that even in your time people can live very comfortably. It
is only necessary to be reasonable, to make a good start, to
know how to use your means to the best advantage. "
" Yes , yes , I know it. "

" Now go and see a little more carefully how these people are living some time after they began to understand what
you understood long ago."

They enter a house ; again the same sort of enormous,
magnificent parlors. A party is in progress , full of gayety
and joy.

It is three hours since sunset ; it is the very tide

of joy. How bright the parlor is lighted ! With what?
no candelabra are to be seen anywhere, nor gas-jets. Akh !
it is from here - in the rotunda of the hall is a great pane
through which the light falls ; of course it must be such -

just like sunlight, white, bright, and soft ; this is the electric
light. There are a thousand people in the hall, but there is
room enough for thrice as many .

" And there are thrice as

many when they have company," says the radiant one,
" and sometimes even more ."

" What is it ? Is it not a ball ? Is it a mere every-day
gathering ? "
" Certainly."

At the present day this would have been a court ball, so
bright, so magnificent are the costumes of the women . Yes ,
it is other times, as you can see by the cut of the dresses .
There are some ladies in the dress of our time ; but it is

evident that they wear them for variety's sake, as a joke ;
yes, they are masquerading, making sport of this kind of
dress.

Others wear most varied costumes of different

eastern and southern cuts, but all of them are more grace-

ful than ours . But the predominating costume seems like
the one worn by the Grecian women during the artistic age

of Athens, very easy and comfortable ; and the men also
wear wide and flowing garments without waists,- something
like mantles or cloaks ,-evidently their every-day housedress .

But how tasteful and beautiful this dress !

How

soft and exquisitely it outlines the form ! how it adds to the
grace of the motions ! And what an orchestra ! There are
more than a hundred musicians, both men and women ; but
above all what a choir !

" No , in all Europe in your day there were not ten such
voices as you find here by the hundred, and in every
other house it is the same .

But the style of life is very

different from that of old ; it is very healthy, and at the
same time very elegant, and therefore the chest becomes

broader and the voice better," says the radiant tsaritsa.
But the people in the orchestra and in the choir are con-

stantly changing; some leave, and others take their place.
Some go to dance, and some from among the dancers release
them .

This evening is an every-day, ordinary evening ; they
dance and enjoy themselves every evening in this way.
But did I ever see such energetic joy ? And how can their
joy help having an energy unknown to ours? They work
well in the morning. Whoever has not worked enough does
not give his nervous system the zest, and so cannot feel the

fulness of the enjoyment. And even now the happiness of
the common people, if by chance they succeed in living
happy, is more intense, keen, and fresh than ours ; but the
chances for our common people to be happy are very poor.
But here the means of happiness are richer than for us ;
and the happiness of our common people is disturbed by

the remembrance of the inconveniences and deprivations,
misfortunes and sufferings in the past, and by the anticipation of similar things to come . Their happiness is a transitory forgetfulness of want and woe. But can want and woe

be absolutely forgotten? Do not the sands of the desert
spread ? Do not the miasmas of the swamp bring contagion
upon the small plan of the good land which may have good
air between the desert and the swamp ?
But here there are no remembrances , no dangers of want
and woe ; there are only remembrances of free labor with

full satisfaction, of abundance, of good, and of enjoyment.
Here the expectations of the time to come are the same.

What a comparison ! And again, the nerves only of our
working people are strong, and therefore they are able to
endure a great deal of enjoyment ; but they are coarse ,
obtuse ; but here the nerves are strong as those of our

laborers , and developed, susceptible , just as with us. The
preparation for enjoyment, a healthy, keen thirst for it, such
as none of our day have, such as is given only by perfect
and physical labor, are combined in people here with all the
delicacy of sense such as we have. They have all our
mental culture together with the physical development of our
strong working people. It is comprehensible that their
enjoyment, that their pleasure, that their passion, are more
lively, keener, wider, and sweeter than with us. Happy
people !


======================================================================

A VITAL QUESTION.

387

No ; people now do not know what enjoyment means,
because as yet there is no sort of life adapted to it, and there

are no such people. Only such people can be fully happy
and know all the glory of enjoyment. How they flourish in
health and strength ! how slender and graceful they are ! how
full of energy and expression are their features ! All of
them are joyous and beautiful men and women, living free
lives of labor and enjoyment. Happy are they ! happy are
they!

With a joyous noise half of them meet together in the
mighty hall - but where are the other half ?
" Where are the others ? " asks the radiant tsaritsa ;

" they are everywhere : some of them are in the theatre, some
are actors, some are musicians , others are spectators , just as

it may please them ; some of them are scattered in the lecturehalls , museums, or in the libraries ; some of them are in the

alleys of the garden ; some in their rooms, or are taking rest
in seclusion , or are with their children ; but more, more than
all, and this is my secret....

" This is my kingdom. Here everything is for me ! Labor
the readiness for enjoyment of feelings and strength for
me - enjoyment is the readiness for me and rest after me.
Here I am the aim of life ; here I am the whole of life ."

" In my sister, the tsaritsa, lies the loftiest enjoyment of
life," says the oldest sister ; " but you shall see that every
happiness here is suited to every one's special faculty. All
live here in the way that it is best for each to live ; there is
a full volition, a free volition for every one here .

" What you have been shown here will not soon reach its
full development as you have just seen it. A good many
generations will pass before your presentiment of it will be

realized. No, not many generations : my work is now advancing rapidly, more rapidly with every year ; but still you
will never see the full sway of my sister, at least you have
seen it ; you know the future.

It is bright, it is beautiful.

Tell everybody. Here is what is to be ! The future is
bright and beautiful. Love it ! seek to reach it ! work for

A YEAR later the new union was in perfect running order.
Both shops were closely connected ; one shop would give the
other orders when there was slack work and the other had

time to fill them. A running account was kept between
them.

Their means proved sufficient to enable them to open

a sale-shop on the Nevsky, when once they had knit the
bonds between them closer still. The arrangement of this
cost Viéra Pavlovna and Mertsálova a great deal of trouble.
Although the two unions were friendly, although one often
gave receptions to the other, although they often united for
picnics out of town, still the idea of the union of accounts of

two different shops was a new idea, of which it was necessary
to give long and careful explanations. However, the benefit
of having their own sale-shop on the Nevsky was evident, and
in a few months of labor in joining the two accounts, Viéra
Pavlovna succeeded in accomplishing it : on the Nevsky
appeared a new sign . " Au Bon Travail : Magasin des Nou-

veautés ." After this sale-shop was opened, the business
began to increase more rapidly than before, and the profits
were much larger. Mertsálova and Viéra Pavlovna already
began to dream that in two years, instead of two shops , there

would be four, five, and then soon ten and twenty.
Three months after the sale-shop was opened, one of Kirsánof's friends, or rather one of his acquaintances at the
medical school, came to him, told him a great deal about his
various medical experiences , and still more about his won
1 Comment on this epic vision is hardly necessary. But those who object to
idealized socialism as presented by Tchernuishevsky must be both enchained by

selfishness and the slaves of Antichrist. Only he who is selfish can wish that the
best that he wishes for should not be shared by all the world; and how many millions
and billions of dollars, how many lives of labor and sadness , are wasted every year

because each family and each man and woman is trying vainly by himself to do what
might be done better, more easily, and more happily by systematic union. The great
corporations which pour useless wealth into the hoards of the few monopolists who
control them, the great bazaars which are now seen in all our cities, point to what,
in the future,will be the physical salvation of the world. The great hotels and flats
are but the practical realization of the homes of the men and women of the future.
But is Tchernuishevsky after all such a rabid radical? Is not his ideal what all

men want when they pray for the coming of the kingdom of Heaven?-- not the
republic of Heaven, by the way.

derfully successful cures, which were performed by laying
across the chest and abdomen two small bags filled with
crushed ice , each of which was wrapped up in four napkins ;

and, at the conclusion of all, he said that one of his acquaintances wanted to make Kirsánof's acquaintance.

Kirsánof granted his request ; it was pleasant acquaintance ; they talked about a good many subjects, among others
about the shop.

He explained that the shop was opened

exclusively for mercantile purposes. They talked about the
sign of the shop, whether it was a good thing to put upon the
sign the word travail. Kirsánof said that travail meant work,
and Au Bon Travail meant a shop that did good work.
They discussed the question whether it would not be better

to put a proper name on instead of such a device. Kirsánof
said that his wife's Russian name would cause a mercantile

failure. Finally he devised the following expedient : His
wife's name was Viéra ; in French Viéra means foi. If on
the sign could be put the words A la Bonne Foi, instead of
Au Bon Travail, would not that be sufficient ?

There would

be nothing suspicious about " a shop of good faith," and
the khozyaïká's name would still be on the sign.

After

arguing the matter over, they decided that it could be done.
Kirsánof, with special cagerness , turned the conversation to
questions like this, and he generally succeeded in obtaining
his purpose. So that, when he returned home, he was very
well content with himself.

But, at all events , Mertsálova and Viéra Pavlovna consid-

erably clipped the wings of their imaginations, and they
began to work hard to go ahead with their present enterprise.
Thus , after their superfluous enthusiasm about opening a

good many shops had cooled down, the sewing union and
the sale-shop still lived, not developing with too great rapidity, but rejoicing in the very fact of existence. Kirsánof's
new acquaintance continued to afford him much pleasure .
Thus passed two years or more, without any events of special
importance.

A LETTER FROM EKATERINA VASILYEVNA PÓLOZOVA.
ST. PETERSBURG, Aug. 29, 1860.
MY DEAR PAULINA, -

I have been so delighted with an absolute novelty which I
have lately discovered, and to which I am now devoting all
my energies, that I want to describe it to you. I am sure
that you too will become interested in it. But the main
thing is , you yourself may find it possible to undertake something of the same sort. It is so delightful, my dear.
The thing which I am going to describe to you is a sewing
shop, or rather two shops, both arranged on one plan by a
woman with whom I became acquainted only two weeks ago ,
and who is already a real friend . I am now helping her, on
condition that she should help me by and by to arrange a
similar shop . This Madame Viéra Pavlovna Kirsánova is
still young, gay, kind, and - entirely to my taste ; that is,
she is more like you, Paulina, than your Katya, who is such
a queer soul - is an open-hearted, lively lady. After I
heard accidentally about her sewing shop, I was told only
about one of them.

I went directly to her without any in-

troduction or subterfuges, and simply said that I had become
interested in her shop.

We were drawn to each other from

the very first ; all the more, because Kirsánof, her husband,
I found the very same Doctor Kirsánof who, five years ago,
did me , you remember, such magnificent service.

After we talked half an hour, and she saw that I really
sympathized with such things , Viéra Pavlovna took me over
her shop, the one in which she has an active part (the first
one which she established was taken in charge by one of her

acquaintances, a very nice young married lady) , and I am
going to tell you the impressions of my first visit.

They

were so new and striking, that I took them down at that time

in my diary, though I had long before ceased to keep it,
but which I have begun again for a special reason, which
maybe I will tell you about at some other time. I am very,
very glad that I put these impressions on paper, for by this
time I should have forgotten a good many impressions which
surprised me then ; and to-day, only two weeks after, it

seems to me the most ordinary thing in the world, - indeed,
as though it could not be otherwise.

But the more common-

place this thing becomes to me, the more I get attached to
it, because it is a very good thing. And so, Paulina, I shall
begin the quotation from my diary, adding such particulars
as I have since learned .

A sewing shop - what do you think that I saw there ?
We stopped at the main entrance. Viéra Pavlovna led me
up a very nice flight of stairs , such stairs as you often find
decorated with Switzers . We went in on the third floor ;

Viéra Pavlovna rang the bell, and I found myself in a great
parlor with a grand piano and handsome furniture - in a
word, the parlor seemed like that of a private family spend-

ing for their living four or five thousand rubles a year. Is
that the shop ? Is this one of the rooms occupied by the
seamstresses ? " Yes . This is the reception room and parlor for evening gatherings ; let us go to those rooms where

the seamstresses live. They are now in the working rooms,
and we shall disturb no one . "

Here is what I saw as I went

from room to room, and Viéra Pavlovna explained to me.
The whole establishment of the shop is composed of three

apartments , which open upon one landing and which was
made into one apartment after the doors which led between
them were taken away. These apartments used to be rented

for seven hundred, five hundred and fifty, and four hundred
and twenty-five rubles a year, a total of one thousand six

hundred and seventy-five rubles. But when they were rented
all together on a five years' lease, the landlord agreed to
let them have it for twelve hundred and fifty. All in all,
there are twenty-one rooms in the shop, two of which are
very large, having four windows ; one is the reception room,

the other the dining-room; in two others, also large ones,
the work is carried on. They use the rest for living-rooms .
We went through six or seven rooms, in which the girls were
living. (I am still referring to my first visit.) These rooms
are nicely furnished in mahogany or walnut. Some of them
have tall mirrors ; in others there are very handsome pier

glasses ; a good many well-made chairs and sofas. The furniture in each room varies, nearly all of it at bargains for
low prices. These rooms in which they live are like the
apartments such as middle-class tchinovniks occupy, the
families of old natcholniks of departments or young office
natcholniks who are on the road to becoming natcholniks of


======================================================================

departments . The larger rooms are occupied by three girls ;
in one, live as many as four, but in the other, only two.
We went into the working rooms, and the girls busy there
seemed to be dressed like the daughters , sisters , or young
wives of tchinovniks ; some wore silk dresses of simple

stuffs ; some barège, some of muslin. The faces had that
softness and freshness which are developed only by comfort.
You can imagine how all this surprised me. We stayed quite
a while in the working rooms , and I got acquainted here with

some of the girls. Viéra Pavlovna told them why I called.
The degree of their accomplishments was unequal. Some of
them spoke with the language of cultured society, were acquainted with literature like our bariushnas, had a good idea

of history and about foreign lands, and about all sorts of
things which go to make up the ordinary run of ideas among
the young ladies of our society. Two of them were really
well read. Some of them who entered the shop recently
were less developed, but still you could speak with each of
them as with a girl of some culture. As a general thing the
degree of development was proportionate to the time the girl
had been in the shop .

Viéra Pavlovna attended to various things ; occasionally
she came back to me , and I talked with the girls , and thus we
spent the time till dinner. Dinner every day is composed of

About one of them. I day they had rice soup, boiled fish ,

between the leaves of my diary. I am going to copy it for
you ; but first I want to say a few words more .
Instead of poverty, comfort ; instead of filth, not only
cleanliness , but even some luxury ; instead of rudeness , is
considerable culture.

All this is the result of two causes .

On the one hand, the number of the sewing girls is increasing ; on the other, a great economy in expenditure.
You see why they get more income ; they are working on
their own account ; they are their own mistresses ; and therefore they receive that part which would be kept as profit by
the head of the shop. But this is not all ; while working for
their own benefit and on their own account, they are much

more careful in using what they are working upon, and of
their time ; the work is done more rapidly, and there are less
expenses in it .

Naturally there is also a great deal of economy in regard
to their living expenses. They buy all things in large quantities ; they pay ready cash for everything, and so they get
things cheaper than if they bought on credit and at retail.
The things are carefully selected because they understand

their business ; and so everything is bought not only cheaper
but also better than poor people generally have a chance to
buy.

Besides this, many of their expenses are greatly diminished, cr become entirely unnecessary. Think, for instance,
to go every day two or three visits to the shop, how much
wear and tear comes on the shoes and clothes !

I shall give

you one little example which can be applied in everything of
this sort.

Not to have an umbrella means to spoil a dress

from the rain .

Now listen to what Viéra Pavlovna told me.

A simple linen umbrella costs , let us suppose, two rubles.
There are twenty-five sewing girls who live in the shop . An
umbrella for each would cost fifty rubles ; and whoever had

no umbrella would lose more than two rubles by the destruction of clothes. But they live together ; no one of them
leaves the house unless she pleases, and so it happens that
in stormy weather only a few go out.

five umbrellas were enough.

So they found that

These umbrellas are nice silk

ones ; they cost five rubles apiece. All the cost of umbrellas
is twenty-five rubles, or a ruble apiece for each girl. You

see that each one of them is using a good one instead of a
bad one, and at the same time has only a half of the expense.

And so it is with a good many trifles which amount to a good


======================================================================

394

A VITAL QUESTION.

deal in the long run . Just as it is with their rent, so it is
with the table. For instance, this dinner which I told you
about cost five rubles and fifty kopeks, or five rubles and
seventy-five kopeks, with bread, but without tea and coffee.

At the table were thirty-seven people besides me and Viéra
Pavlovna .

Of course several children were included in that

number. Five rubles and seventy-five kopeks for thirtyseven people makes less than sixteen kopeks¹ apiece, less
than five rubles a month.

And Viéra Pavlovna says that if

a person dines by himself, he can have scarcely anything for
this money except bread and such wretched stuff as you find
at small stores . At a restaurant, a dinner like this, only not
so nicely served, would cost forty kopeks , according to Viéra
Pavlovna. For thirty kopeks it would be much worse. This

difference can be appreciated ; a restaurant keeper, while
preparing a dinner for twenty people or less, must support
himself on this money, must have a house, and have a servant. But here these extra expenses are entirely done away

with, or are greatly diminished.

The wages of two old

women, who are relations of two of the sewing girls, and

that is the whole expense of the kitchen stuff. Now you
render the calculation which Kirsánof made for me by way
of example, when I called upon them for the first time.
After he wrote it, he said : —

" Of course I can't give exact figures, as it would be hard
to get at them, because you know each mercantile enterprise ,
each selling shop, each sewing shop, has its own income and
expense account, just as each family has its own degree
of economy in incurring expenses with special proportions
between their various expenditures .

I am giving you the

figures only by way of example ; but to make the account
more impressive, I shall make the figures less than the real
profits of our concern, in comparison with the real expenses
of almost every commercial enterprise and almost every poor
family.
" The receipts of a commercial enterprise from the sale of

goods," continued Kirsánof, " is divided into three main
portions : one goes for the salary of the employees ; the
second for the other expenses of the concern, say the rent of
the building, lights, materials for works ; the third makes
the khozydïn's income. Let us suppose that the receipts
are divided in this proportion : for the wages of the emEight cents.

ployees , half of the receipts ; for the other expenses, onefourth ; the last quarter is profit.

This means that if the

employees receive one hundred rubles, then the other expenses rate fifty rubles ; the khozydïn has also fifty rubles.
Now let us see what the employees receive according to our
system." Kirsánof began to read his scale of figures : 100 rubles

They receive their salary

They are themselves employers, and thus they
receive the income of the khozyáïn
Their working rooms are joined to their own
private rooms, and so they get them at a
cheaper rate ; they are careful about materials; in this way the saving is greatly
increased, I think a full half, but let us say
a third part : from the 50 rubles which
would go towards this expense they save

50 rubles

16 rubles, 67 kopeks

for their income .

166 rubles, 67 kopeks

" Here we have already," continued Kirsánof, " brought
it about that our working people receive one hundred and

sixty- six rubles and sixty-seven kopeks, when, according to the
other order of things, they would have only a hundred rubles.
But they gain still more : working for their own benefit, they
work more industriously, and therefore more successfully,
quicker. Let us suppose that in an ordinary, uninspired
work they would succeed in making five things -in our trade,

five dresses ; now they succeed in making six.
tion is too small ; but let us adopt it.

This propor-

Then, at a time when

an ordinary enterprise is earning five rubles, ours earns
six:

From the rapidity of energetic work the receipts and the income are increased one-

fifth part of 166 rubles, 67 kopeks, thus
Plus the former .

33 rubles, 33 kopeks
166 rubles, 67 kopeks
200 rubles

" Therefore ours have larger profits than others ," continued

Kirsánof.

" Now, as to the use of this profit.

Having

double as much means , we can use them to much better

advantage. Here is a double profit, as you know. In the
first place, from the fact that everything is bought wholesale,
let us suppose that from this a third part is gained. Things

which at retail and on credit would cost three rubles now cost

two. In reality the profit is greater. Let us take, for example, the house : if these rooms were rented singly, there
would live in these seventeen rooms - each with its two win-

dows , three and four persons - a total (say) of fifty-five ; in
two rooms with three windows , six persons each ; and in the
two with four windows , nine persons each . Twelve and
eighteen make thirty, and fifty-five in the little rooms ; thus
the whole apartment would contain eighty-five people. Each

of them would pay three and a half rubles a month, which
makes forty-two rubles a year. And so these petty landlords , who make a business of renting out ' corners ,' take for

such an establishment forty-two multiplied by eighty-five,
3,570 rubles .

Our members have this same establishment

for 1,250 rubles, almost three times as cheap. So it is in a
good many things, almost all, everything. Probably I should
not reach the true proportion, if I estimated the saving at
one-half ; but I shall place it also at a third . And this is

not all.

With such a mode of life they are freed from the

necessity of incurring many expenses , or, rather, they need
many less things . "

Viérotchka here offered, as an example, shoes and dresses .
Let us suppose that from this the quantity of things bought
is diminished by one-fourth ; instead of four pairs of shoes ,
three are sufficient, or three dresses are worn as long as four

used to be. This proportion is also too small ; but see what
results these proportions give ::The cheapness of the things purchased is reckoned as causing a saving of one-third part; that is, suppose that
for three things two rubles are spent instead of three ;
but, according to our system, these three things satisfy
as many necessities as in the old system would have
been satisfied by not less than four: that is equivalent
to saying that for our 200 rubles our seamstresses have
as many things as, according to the old system, they
got for 300 rubles ; and that these things, according to
our system, afford them as many comforts as in the old
system would have been afforded by a sum of

400 rubles

proportion, if not even larger. With this system there are
double receipts, and the profits are used to twice as great
advantage. Is it surprising that you found the life of our
sewing girls quite different from what seamstresses had according to the old system ? ”

Here is the marvel which I saw, my dear Paulina, and this
is its simple explanation. I am so used to it now that it
seems strange to me how it ever did seem strange to me that
I did never expect to find such a state of things as I found.
Write me, if ever you have the chance of devoting yourself
to what I am getting ready to do ; that is, the establishment
of a sewing shop, or another shop on the same system.
It is so delightful, Paulina !

P.S. I forgot entirely to speak about the other shop ; but
no matter ; let it go till next time. Now I will only say that
the older shop has branched out more, and therefore in all
respects higher, than the one which I described to you. In
the details of the arrangements there is a great difference

between them, because everything is made to suit circumstances .


======================================================================

A VITAL QUESTION.

PART FIFTH .
NEW PEOPLE, AND THE FINALE.
I.

MISS PÓLOZOVA, in her letter to her friend, referred to her

gratitude to Viéra Pavlovna's husband.

To explain this it

is necessary to explain what kind of a man her father was .

Pólozof was a retired cavalry captain, or second captain of
horse,¹ who, while in service, according to the custom of the
olden time, had squandered and gambled away quite a large
patrimonial estate. But after he had squandered it all, he
resigned, and settled down to the creation of a new fortune .
Having gathered the last crumbs which were left, he found
that he had ten thousand rubles in assignats. He went into
the retail grain business ; he began to undertake all sorts of

small contracts ; he made the most of every profitable enterprise which was within his means, and at the end of ten years
he had a good property. With the reputation of being such
a substantial and enterprising man, with his rank and famous
name in his neighborhood , he was able to choose from among
the merchants' daughters of the two districts where his business transactions were carried on ; and he selected very discretely one with a dowry of half a million, all in assignats.
He was then fifty years old, and this was twenty years before
we see his daughter entering into friendly relations with Viéra
Pavlovna. Adding such a pile to his former wealth, he extended his business on a wider scale, and ten years later he
became a millionaire in silver rubles , as at this time silver
began to replace paper. His wife died. As she was used

to provincial life, she had kept him from moving to Petersburg. Now he moved to Petersburg , " pushed up the hill "
more rapidly still, and in ten years was regarded as the possessor of three or four million rubles. Girls and widows,
young and old, set their caps at him ; but he had no wish

to marry the second time, partly because he preserved a genuine feeling for his wife's memory, and, moreover, because
he did not want to give Kátya, whom he loved very warmly,
a stepmother.
Pólozof pushed and pushed up the mountain ; he would

have had not three, not four millions, but ten, if he had given
himself to monopolies ; but he despised them, and he considered contracts and supplies the only honest business. His
confreres in the millionocracy laughed at such a slight and
delicate distinction, and they were not wrong ; but he, though
he was not in the right, kept repeating his pet phrase, “ I
am a commercial man, and I do not want to get rich by
robbery." But a year or a year and a half before his
daughter made Viéra Pavlovna's acquaintance there ap-

peared too clear proof that there was very little difference
between his trade and monopoly, as far as the facts of the
matter were concerned, though there was a great difference
according to his ideas . He undertook a great contract ;
whether it was linen, or provisions , or boot-leather, I am not
sure ; but as he had been becoming every year more stubborn

and supercilious on account of his age and his constant success, and the increasing respect with which he was regarded,
he quarrelled with an important personage, got rather angry ,
berated him , and the job proved to be a bad one. At the

end of a week they bade him cat humble pie : he said, " I
won't" ; " You will collapse " ; " All right, but I won't give
in." In a month he was told the same thing ; he made the
same reply ; and really, as far as eating humble pie was concerned, he ate no humble pie ; but as far as collapsing went he collapsed ! His goods were rejected ; moreover, whether
there were actual faults , or whether it came from ill will, at
all events , his three or four millions vanished. And Pólozof,

at the age of seventy, found himself a beggar ; that is , a
beggar compared to what he had been ; but still, without any
comparison with what he had been, he lived well ; he had
some shares in a stearine factory, and without hanging down
his nose, accepted the position of manager of this factory, at
a good salary. Besides that, there remained, by some
chance, a few tens of thousands of rubles .

If such remnants

of his fortune had been in his hands fifteen or ten years
before, they would have been enough to help him push himself up a respectable mountain.

But being over sixty, it

was hard for him to push himself, and Pólozof argued that


======================================================================

400

A VITAL QUESTION.

it was too late for him to try such a thing, and not within
his strength. Now he thought only about arranging as
quickly as possible the sale of the factory, the shares of
which gave him scarcely any income, or any credit, and the
affairs of which it was difficult to bring into a better order.
He argued the case cleverly, and he succeeded in explaining

to the other chief shareholders that a quick sale was the only
way of saving the money buried in the shares. Another
thing which occupied his mind was a suitable marriage for
his daughter. But the main thing was to sell the factory,
turn all the money into five per cent governmental bonds ,
which were at that time in vogue, and to live the remainder

of his days peacefully, remembering his past grandeur, the
loss of which he bore bravely, preserving all his gayety and
firmness .
II.

THE father loved his Kátya; he did not allow ultra-high-

society's governesses to train the girl too severely. " That
is nonsense ," he used to say at all straightenings of the
figure , straightening of the manners, and everything of this
sort ; and when Kátya was fifteen years old, he agreed with
her that she could do without English and French governesses . Thus Kátya was entirely at her ease ; she felt full
freedom in the house .

And freedom for her at that time was

not to be disturbed in her reading and dreaming. She had
few friends among girls, though two or three were very intimate ; but suitors for her hand she had without number.

She is Pólozof's only daughter ; it's terrible to speak of :
four millions !

But Kátya read and dreamed, and the suitors remained in
despair. And Katya reached the age of seventeen. Thus
she read and dreamed , and did not fall in love ; but she sud-

denly began to grow thin, and pale, and languid.
III .

KIRSANOF did not care to practise, but he did not consider.
it right for him to refuse consultations. But at this timeit was a year after he became professor, and a year before he

married Viéra Pavlovna - the Big Wigs of the Petersburg
medical world began to invite him very often to consultations.


======================================================================

A VITAL QUESTION.

There were two reasons for it.

401.

The first was that there hap-

pened to be in the courts a certain Claude Bernard who had
lived in Paris. One of the Big Wigs, who went to Paris for
some reason, scientific or other, saw with his own eyes Claude
Bernard, - the real living Claude Bernard. He introduced
himself with his rank, his name, his decorations , and his

famous patient ; and Claude Bernard, after listening to him
for half an hour, said, " It was idle for you to come to Paris
to learn the successes of medicine ; you had no need of leav-

ing Petersburg for that purpose." The Big Wig took this as
an attestation of his own fame, and after he came back to

Petersburg mentioned Claude Bernard's name no less than
ten times in the course of twenty-four hours, adding to it no
less than five times, " my learned friend " or " my famous
comrade in science." How could he help calling Kirsánof to
consultations after that ? It was impossible not to ! And
the second reason was still more important : all the Big Wigs

saw that Kirsánof was not trying to get away their practice.
He not only did not take cases, but even when eagerly requested did not take them.

It is known that many of the

Big Wigs who practise have this custom : if death, according
to the opinion of the Big Wig, is inevitably approaching the
patient, and if, by unfortunate change, they cannot get rid of
the patient by sending him to any mineral springs or to any
place abroad, then it is necessary to place him in the hands
of some other medical man ; and in these circumstances the

Big Wig is willing to offer money from his own pocket for
his colleague to take the case. Kirsánof , in these cases where
the Big Wig, with the intention of running away, asked him

to take a patient, was rarely willing ; he generally recommended such of his friends as were in active practice, and he
took for himself only a few cases which were interesting from

a scientific point of view.

But how could they help inviting

to their consultations this confrère who was recognized by

Claude Bernard, and who did not take away their practice ?
Pólozof the millionnaire had a doctor who was the very ace

of trumps among the Big Wigs, and when Katerina Vasilyevna became dangerously ill, the consultations for a long
time were held by the Big Wigs exclusively. Finally the case
became so serious that the Big Wigs decided to inviteKirsánof ;
and really the task was very tough for the Big Wigs. The
sick girl had no evident disease, but her strength was rapidly
failing. It is neces
necessary to get at the root of the trouble. The


======================================================================

A VITAL QUESTION.

attending doctor called it atrophia nervorum

innutrition of

the nerves . Whether there is any such disease as that in the
world I do not know ; but if there is, then even I can under-

stand that it must be incurable. But if, notwithstanding its
incurableness , she still must be cured, then let Kirsánof do
it, or some of his friends , those impudent little boys !
And so a new consultation with Kirsánof was arranged.
They examined the patient ; they asked her questions.

The

patient answered readily, without excitement. But Kirsánof,
after the first words, stopped questioning her and merely
watched the Big Wigs making the investigation. And after
they had exhausted their ingenuity and tormented the girl as
much as propriety requires in such cases, they turned to Kirsánof, " What do you think, Aleksandr Matvéitch ? "
He replied, " I have not sufficiently examined the patient.
I shall stay here. This is an interesting case.

If a new con-

sultation should be needed, I shall tell Karl Feodorvitch."
(That was the name of the attendant physician, who shone
with glory because he was saved from his atrophia nervorum. )
After they left, Kirsánof sat down by the patient's bedside .
The sick girl smiled satirically.
" I am sorry that we are not better acquainted," he began .

" A doctor must win confidence, and maybe I shall succeed in
winning yours . They do not understand your troubles here ;
some sagacity is needed . To sound your lungs, to give you
medicines, is absolutely useless. Only one thing is necessary :
to know your general condition, and to think with you whether
it is possible to do anything. You will help me in regard to
this? "

The sick girl said not a word.
" You do not want to talk with me ? "

The sick girl said not a word.

" You probably even want me to leave. I ask of you only
ten minutes. If in ten minutes you find, as you think now,
that my presence is useless, I shall go. Don't you know well
that you have no other disease than sorrow ? Don'tyou know
that if this state of mind lasts, it will be impossible in three
weeks or a fortnight, or even sooner, to save you ? and that
maybe you will not live two weeks ? As yet you are not in
consumption at all, but it is very, very near, and at your age
under such conditions it develops with unusual rapidity ; it
may end in a few days."
The sick girl said not a word.


======================================================================

A VITAL QUESTION.

403

" You do not reply. But you do not care at all. Therefore my words were not new to you. By the very fact of
your silence you say ' yes .' Do you know what almost any
other man would know in my place ? He would go and speak
with your bátiushka. Maybe my talk with him would save
you ; but if you do not want me to, I shall not do it. Why ?
I make it a rule, nothing should ever be done for a person
against his will ; liberty is above everything, even life .
Therefore if you don't want me to know the cause of your
very dangerous condition, I shall not know it. If you tell
me that you want to lie, I would only ask you to explain to
me the causes of this wish .

If they should appear to me

groundless , I still have no right to interfere with you ; if
they appear to me reasonable, I am bound to help you, and
I am ready. I am ready to give you poison. Under this
condition I ask you to tell me the cause of your illness."
The sick girl said not a word .

" You do not want to answer me ; I have no right to continue these questions. But may I ask you to allow me to
tell you something about myself which may serve to increase
the confidence between us . Yes ? Thank you. Whatever
the reason may be, you are suffering. I am too. I passionately love a woman who must never know that I love her.

Do you pity me ? "
The sick girl said not a word, but she smiled sorrowfully .

" You are silent, but still you could not hide that you
noticed these words of mine more than those that I spoke

before. That is sufficient of itself. I see that you and
Ihave one cause of suffering. Do you want to die? I understand it very well. But to die of consumption is long, is
hard ; I am ready to help you to die, if I cannot help you
to something better. I say that I am ready to give you
poison - a delightful something that kills quick, without
causing pain. Will you please let me know on this condition
whether your position is so intolerable as it seems to you ? "
" Won't you deceive me ? " demanded the sick girl.
" Look me straight in the eye ; you see that I will not
deceive you ."

The sick girl hesitated for some time. “ No ; I know you
very little ."

" Any one else in my place might have said that the feeling
from which you are suffering is good.

I shall not say so .

Does your bátiushka know about it? I beg you to remember


======================================================================

404

A VITAL QUESTION.

that I am not going to speak with him without your permission."

" He does not know . "

"Does he love you ?"
" Yes ."

" What do you think that I am going to tell you now ?
You say that he loves you ; I have heard that he was a
stupid. What makes you think that it will be useless for
you to reveal to him your feeling, that he will not consent ?

If the obstacle had lain simply in the poverty of the man
whom you love, this would not have kept you from trying to
persuade your father to give his consent ; that is what I
think about it. Therefore I must think that you entertain
an exceedingly poor opinion of him ; there could be no
other reason for you to hide the matter from your father.
Isn't it so ? "

The sick girl said not a word.
" It is evident that I am not mistaken. What shall I think

now ? Your bátiushka is a man of experience in life, who
knows human nature ; you are inexperienced ; if any person

seems bad to him, and good to you, then according to all
probabilities it is you who are mistaken, and not he. You
see that I must think so ? Do you want to know why I tell
you such a disagreeable thing ? I will tell you. You may
get angry at my words, you may hate me because of them,
but still you will say to yourself, He is saying what he thinks ;
he is nothypocritical, he does not want to deceive me.' You
are gaining confidence in me. Isn't it true that I am speaking sincerely with you ? "
The sick girl was hesitating whether to answer or not.
" You are a strange man, doctor," she said, at last .

" No , not strange ; but I am not like one who deceives .
I have told you straightforwardly what I think. But this is
only my supposition. Maybe I am mistaken. Let me
know whether I am .

Tell me the name of the man towards

whom you feel this inclination. Then but again, only
with your permission - I will speak about him to your
bátiushka."

" What will you tell him ? "
" Does he know him intimately ? "
" Yes ."

" In that case , I shall tell him that he must consent to

your marriage, but only on one condition, that the time of


======================================================================

405

the wedding be appointed not immediately, but in two or
three months, so that you may have time to think coolly,

whether you may not be right."
" He will not consent ."

" He will consent in all probability. But if not, I will
help you , as I said."
Kirsánof spoke long in this style. Finally he succeeded
in getting the sick girl to tell him the man's name, and to let
him talk with her father.

But to bring the old man to terms

was a harder matter than to manage her. Pólozof was
greatly surprised to hear that his daughter's strength had
been failing on account of hopeless love ; and still more surprised to hear the name of the man with whom she was in

love, and he firmly declared : " Let her die sooner than marry
him. Her death would be a lesser grief for both her and
me." It was a very hard case, all the more because Kirsánof
hearing Pólozof's reasons saw that the truth was really on
the side of the old man, and not his daughter.

IV.

BRIDEGROOMS had swarmed by the hundred around the
heiress of the great fortune ; but the society which flocked
to Pólozof's dinners and suppers was a society of that excessively dubious type, of that excessively dubious refinement,

which is generally found crowding the parlors of all such
rich people as Pólozof, lifted above the more or less polite

but still not fashionable circle in which they are born, without having any relationship or connection in the more or less

genuinely polite society of the fashionable world.

They

become the benefactors of cunning adventurers and dandies

who are absolutely indecent in their outward appearance,
without speaking of their inward qualities. Therefore,
Katerina Vasilyevna became interested when among the
number of admirers came a genuine society man of absolutely
good breeding ; he behaved with so much more refinement ;
he spoke so much more sensibly and wittily than the others .
Her father soon noticed that she was going to prefer him

above the others ; and, as an active, decided, substantial man,
he immediately had a talk with his daughter : " My dear Kátya - Sólovtsof, look out for him ; he is a

very bad man, a perfectly heartless raan ; you would be so


======================================================================

406

A VITAL QUESTION.

unhappy with him, that I would rather see you dead than his
wife.

It would be easier for both me and you ."

Katerina Vasilyevna loved her father ; she was accustomed

to respect his opinion; he never put restrictions upon her ;
she knew that he was speaking thus because he loved her ;
and above all, her character was inclined more to regard the
wishes of those who loved her than of her caprices ; she was

one of those who liked to say to her friends, " I will do as
you think best. "
She answered her father : “ I like Sólovtsof ; but if you
think it is better for me to keep at a distance from him, I
shall do so."

Of course she would not have done so ; and as her nature

was opposed to falsehood, she would not have said so if she
had loved hica. Her attachment to Sólovtsof was as yet
very weak. At that time it had hardly taken root ; he was
merely more interesting to her than others. She began to
grow cool towards him ; and maybe everything would have
ended satisfactorily ; but the father in his zeal put in too
much salt ; and, though in reality he did not put on much,
yet it was enough to salt off the polite Sólovtsof. He saw
that he must play the part of a victim, but how to find a
pretext for becoming a victim. Pólozof somehow stepped
on his toes ; Sólovtsof, with a sense of self-respect and pain
on his face , took leave of them, and ceased his calls . A

week later, Katerina Vasilyevna received from him a passionate and exceedingly humble letter, to the effect that he never
expected that his love would be returned, that for his happiness it would be sufficient for him to see her occasionally ,

even though he did not speak with her but only saw her ;
that he was willing to sacrifice even this happiness, and yet
he would be happy or unhappy, and so on, without a single
request or wish. He did not even ask for a reply. Such
letters kept coming ; and finally they had their effect.
But it took a long time before they had their effect .

Katerina Vasilyevna, at first after Sólovtsof left, was neither

melancholy nor sorrowfully inclined, and even before that
she had been cool to him ; and she accepted so calmly her
father's advice to look out for him, that consequently when ,
after too months, she began to grow despondent, what could
make her father think that Sólovtsof was at the bottom of

it, when he had forgotten all about him ?
" It seems to me you're under the weather, Kátya."


======================================================================

A VITAL QUESTION.

407

" No ; it's nothing - nothing ; it'll pass. "

In aweek or two the old man was already asking, “ Are 、
you ill, Kátya ?"
" No , not at all."

Two weeks later the old man said, " You must see the
doctor, Kátya. "

Kátya begins to consult the doctor ; and the old man is
entirely at ease because the doctor finds no cause of alarm.

" It is only a weakness, some exhaustion " ; and he very
sensibly ascribed it to weariness, arising from Katerina's

style of life the past winter. Every night she had been up
at parties till two or three, or even five o'clock, in the morning. " This exhaustion will pass." But it did not pass ;
it rather increased .

Why did not Katerina Vasilyevna tell her father ? She
was convinced that this would have been in vain.

Her

father had told her before very firmly, and he does not speak
unmeaning words. He does not like to express opinions

about people without being sure of what he says ; and he
will never consent to her marrying a man whom he considers
to be bad.

And so KaterinaVasilyevna kept on dreaming and dreamingwhile reading Sólovtsof's humble and hopeless letters ;
and after half a year's such reading, she was within half a
ster of consumption. And not by a single word could her
father perceive that her disease originated from a matter in
which he was partly to blame ; his daughter had been as
tender towards him as before .

" Is there anything that isn't to your mind ?"
" Nothing, papa."

And it is evident that there is nothing ; she is only out of
spirits , but this is from her weakness , from illness . And
the doctor declares that it is the result of her illness . But
what is the cause of the illness ? As soon as the doctor

regarded the illness as triffing, he contented himself with
laying the blame on dances and corsets ; but when he saw
that it was getting dangerous , then appeared his " innutrition of the nerves ,

atrophia nervorum. "

A VITAL QUESTION.

V.

But if the practising Big Wigs agreed that Mademoiselle
Pólozova's atrophia nervorum, which had been developed
by a weakening mode of life, with the natural inclination
towards dreaminess and melancholy, then not much was left

for Kirsánof to study in the sick girl in order to see that her
decline in strength originated from some mental causes .

Before the consultation, the attending physician explained
to him all the relations which she had had ; family sorrows
there were none ; father and daughter are very dear to each
other; at the same time the father does not know the reason
of the illness, because the attending physician does not know

it. But it is evident that the girl must have a strong character, if she has been able to conceal so long the illness itself,

and has not given her father a single chance to conjecture
the cause. A strong character was also evident by the quiet
tone of her answers during the consultation. She shows no
sign of irritability ; she firmly endures her lot. Kirsánof

saw that such a girl deserved attention.

Can't something be

Interference seemed to him essential ; of

course the thing will be revealed some time, but won't it be
too late ? Consumption is very near at hand, and then no

care can help it. And so he wrestled with the patient for
two hours ; and he succeeded in conquering her suspicion ;
he learned the secret ; and he obtained her permission to
speak about it with her father.
The old man was startled when he heard from Kirsánof

that the cause of his daughter's illness was love for Sólovtsof.
How is this ? Kátya accepted so coolly at that time his advice to beware of him ; she remained so indifferent after he

ceased to call upon them : how then is she dying of love for
him ? Yes , and is it even possible for people to die of love ?

Such exaltations could not appear likely to a person who
was accustomed to lead an exclusively practical life, and to
look upon everything with cool reason. Kirsánof had a
tough subject in him; he kept repeating, " It's a child's
fancy tormenting her, but soon forgotten. " Kirsánof explained and explained ; finally he told him plainly, “ It is
just because she is a child that she does not forget it, and is
dying." Pólozof was persuaded and convinced, but instead
of concession,he pounded the table with his fist, and said in

a tone of concentrated decision, " If she is to die, let her

die; it is better than for her to be unhappy : it would be
easier for both her and me ! " The very same words he had
said to his daughter six months before. Katerina Vasilyevna
was not mistaken in thinking that it was idle to talk with
him.

" But what makes you so stubborn ? I am perfectly convinced that he is a bad man ; but is he really so bad that
death is better than to live with him ? "

" He is ; he has no heart. She is delicate, gentle, but he
is a beastly wretch ! " And Pólozof went on to describe
Sólovtsof, and in such a way that Kirsánof had nothing to
say. And really how could he help agreeing with Pólozof ?
Sólovtsof was the very same Jean who, at the time before Storeshnikof's courtship, ate supper with Serge and
Julia after the opera. It is absolutely true that it is better
for a respectable girl to die than to become the wife of such
a man . He will pollute, he will chill, he will consume with
his wretchedness a respectable woman ; it is far better for
her to die .

Kirsánof was lost in thought for some minutes.
he said at length .

" No,"

" Well, am I really carried away by your

earnestness ? This case is without danger just because he
is so bad. She cannot help seeing it ; only give her time to
look at it calmly."
He began persistently to assure Pólozof what he had expressed to his daughter only as a suggestion, as possible that she would refuse this man whom
nay, even probable

she loved if he was really bad ; and now he was absolutely
sure of it , because the man she loved was very bad.

" I shall not tell you that marriage does not present such
an importance if we look upon it coolly. If a woman is
unhappy, then why should she not leave her husband ? You
consider this improper : your daughter has been brought up

with the very same ideas ; for you and her it seems really an
irremediable loss, and before she would ever adopt new
ideas , she would suffer with such a man till she died a death
worse than consumption. But it is necessary to view the

matter from another standpoint. Why should you not depend upon your daughter's reason ? She is not a fool, is
she ? Always count on reason ; only allow it to act freely,
and it will never prove fallacious when any cause is right.
You yourself are to blame for your daughter's attachment to

him. Let him have free course, and he will bring your
daughter round on your side, if the right is on your side.
Passion blinds , especially if obstacles are put in the way of
it ; remove them, and your daughter will become reasonable.
Give her liberty to love or not to love, and she will see

whether this man is worthy of her love.

Let him be her

' bridegroom ,' and after some time she herself will dismiss
him."

Such a way of looking upon things was entirely new to
Pólozof. He answered sharply that he did not believe any
such nonsense ; that he knows life too well ; that he has seen

too many examples of foolish people, to depend upon their
reason ; and so much the more absurd was it to trust the

reason of a seventeen-year-old girl. Kirsánof tried in vain

to prove to him that follies were committed only on two
occasions,

either under the momentary influence of excite-

ment, or from restraint, in which case he is irritated by resistance . Such ideas seemed entirely ridiculous to Pólozof.
" She has no sense ; it would be foolish to trust such a child

with this fate ; sooner let her die." From such reasoning it
was impossible to stir him.

It is a fact, that no matter how set may be the ideas of a
man who is in the wrong, when a man who is better devel-

oped, who knows more, who understands things more wisely,
works constantly with the purpose of removing his errors ,
the errors must give way. It is so ; but how long does a
logical battle with him last? Of course all the conversation
here recorded will fail of its result, though so far its influence upon Pólozof is not appreciable yet. The old man is
beginning to think over Kirsánof's words. This is unavoidable, and if such conversation should be kept up with him,
he will come to himself.

But he is proud of his experience ;

he looks upon himself as infallible ; he is set and stubborn ;
it is possible to bring him to terms, without doubt, but it
takes time, and all delay is dangerous. A long delay is
surely fatal ; and a long delay is inevitable when a methodical manner of conducting the logical battle with him is employed.

It was necessary to employ radical means. It is risky
without doubt ; but if it is employed, it is only a risk ; without, it is sure death. And the risk in it is, in reality, not
nearly so great as it may seem to a person who is less solid
in his comprehension of the laws of life than this Kirsánof.


======================================================================

A VITAL QUESTION.

411

The risk is not great at all, but it is serious. From the
whole lottery only one ticket is a blank. And there is no
probability of its being drawn- but supposing it were drawn ?
Whoever runs a risk must be ready not to wink if he draws
the blank .

Kirsánof saw the girl's calm, quiet firmness , and

he was sure of her. But had he the right to subject her to
the risk ?

Of course he had.

Now , out of a hundred

chances , there is only one that she will not lose her health
in this case .

More than half of them are that she will lose

it rapidly. But here, out of a thousand chances , one would
be against her. Let her risk the lottery, though it is apparently more terrible because it is more rapid, but in reality it
is incomparably less dangerous .

"All right," said Kirsánof.

" You do not want to cure

her by those means which are in your power ; I shall cure
her with mine . To-morrow I shall have another consultation."

After he returned to the sick girl, he told her that her

father was stubborn, more stubborn than he expected, and
that it would be necessary to act towards him with severe
measures .

" No ; it is of no use," said the sick girl, despondently.
" Are you sure of it ? "
" Yes ."

" Are you ready to die ? "
" Yes ."

" Now supposing that I decide to subject you to the risk
of death. I told you briefly, in order to gain your confidence, to show you that I am ready for everything that may
be for your good ; now I speak positively. Supposing that
it be necessary to administer poison ? "
" I have seen this long time that my death is inevitable ;
that I have only a few days longer to live."
" Supposing it were to-morrow morning ? ”
" So much the better." She spoke with perfect calmness .

" When there is only one salvation left, and that is your
readiness to die, this support will almost always save you.
If you say to any one, 'Give in, or I shall die,' you almost
always gain what you wish. But you know that one should
not play with such a lofty principle ; and besides, it is impossible for you to lower your self-respect if they don't yield .
And therefore it is necessary to die." He explained to her
the plan, which was perfectly comprehensible from this conversation .

VI.

Or course in other cases of this sort Kirsánof would not

have thought of running such a risk ; it would be more simple
to take the girl from home, and let her marry whomsoever she

pleased. But here the affair was complicated by the girl's
ideas , and the peculiarities of the man whom she loved.

With her ideas of the inseparability of husband and wife, she
would have clung to the wretched man even if she had found
that to live with him was a torment.

be worse than to kill.

To unite them would

Therefore there remained one choice ,

either to kill, or to give her the possibility of coming to
reason .

On the next day the consultation was held, composed of
some of the practitioners in the high world. There are five
doctors , the most renowned ; it is impossible not to have the
best ; how otherwise could they bend Pólozof ? It was nec-

essary that the sentence should be without appeal in his
eyes . Kirsánof spoke ; they listened with great condescen-

sion to what he said, and they all confirmed it with an air
of great importance. It could not be otherwise, because,
you remember, there is in existence a certain Claude Bernard, and he lives in Paris ; and besides that, Kirsánof says
such things which -but the plague take these boys ! You
can't understand them ! Then how can you help agreeing
with them ?

Kirsánof said that he had examined the invalid very carefully, and he entirely agreed with Karl Feodorvitch that the
illness is incurable, and the agony of this disease is torture ;

and, generally speaking, every additional hour that the sick
girl shall live is an additional hour of suffering.

Therefore

he considers that it is the duty of the consulting physicians
to decide according to the dictates of humanity to shorten

the sick girl's sufferings by a dose of morphine, from which
she would not awaken. The consulting physicians investigated the case, blinking their eyes under the hailstones of
incomprehensible explanations on the part of Kirsánof; they
came back from the sick girl's room to the one where they
had been sitting ; and they decided to shorten the sick girl's
sufferings by a fatal dose of morphine .
After the decision was made, Kirsánof rang for the ser-

vant, and asked him to call Pólozof into the parlor, where


======================================================================

413

A VITAL QUESTION.

the consultation was held.

Pólozof came in.

The most im-

portant of the sages, in appropriately gloomily solemn language and in a majestically funereal voice, announced the
decision of the consulting physicians .
Pólozof started back as though struck on the forehead by
a hammer.

To be waiting for death, when death is at hand.

but uncertain how soon it may come, or whether it may come
at all, and to hear that in half an hour she will not be among
the living, are two absolutely different things. Kirsánof
looked at Pólozof with an intense gaze ; he was absolutely
sure of the effect, but still the thing was a strain on his
nerves . Two minutes the old man stood silent, horrorstricken .

" No ; it must not be ! She is dying from my stubbornI am ready for anything. Can she get well ? "

ness .

" Of course," said Kirsánof.

The famous practitioners would have been greatly stirred

to wrath, if they had had time for it ; that is, to exchange
glances , and to see that " my colleagues also like me understand that I have been a doll in the hands of this young boy. "
But Kirsánof allowed them no time to turn their attention to

the thought, " how others looked on me."

Kirsánof told the

servant to conduct the frightened Pólozof from the room ;
thanked them for their shrewdness, which they had displayed
in fathoming his intentions, for their understanding that the
cause of the illness was mental suffering ; that it was neces-

sary to frighten the stubborn old man, who would otherwise
have lost his daughter.

The famous practitioners went each

his way, satisfied that his scientific knowledge and shrewdness was recognized by all the others .
But having given them this brief testimony of their skill ,
Kirsánof went to tell the sick girl that the plan had succeeded .
At the first words she seized his hand, and he had hardly
time to take it away from her before she would have kissed
it. " But I shall not let your father come quite yet, to tell

you the same thing," he said. " I shall first give him a lecture as to the way that he should behave himself towards
you ." He told her that he was going to give her father some
good advice , and that he should not leave him until he had
firmly implanted it.

Shocked by the result of the consultation, the old man became very pliable ; and he regarded Kirsánof, not with the
same eyes as the day before, but with such as Marya Alek

séyevna looked upon Lopukhóf, after dreaming of Lopukhóf
as a monopolist .

Yesterday a natural thought was always in Pólozof's mind.
" I am older than you, and more experienced. Yes , there
is no one in the world smarter than I am ; and as for you,
milk- sucker and bubby , so much the less reason have I to

listen to you , since I, with my own reason, have made four

millions " (although in reality they were only two, and not
four) . " You try to make two millions, and then talk." But
now he thought, " What a bear he is ! how he routed me !
He knows how to break one in." And the more he spoke

with Kirsánof, the more lively arose before him, in addition
to the quality of " bear," another picture - an old and forgotten recollection of his life as a hussar : his riding-master, ¹
Zakhártchenko, was sitting on his horse, “ Gromoboi " (at

that time Zhukovsky's ballads were fashionable among young
ladies , and therefore to a certain extent among young cavaliers, both in the army and civil life) , and " Gromoboi" was
prancing under Zakhartchenko, only " Gromoboi's " lips were
covered with blood . Pólozof was somewhat horrified, as he
heard Kirsánof's answer to his first question .

" Would you really have given her a fatal dose ?"
" Certainly I should," replied Kirsánof, with absolute
sang-froid.
" What a murderer !

He talks like a cook about a dead

chicken ! And you would have courage for it?"
" Of course I should. What a clout I should be if I
hadn't ! "

" You are a terrible man ! " said Pólozof again .
" It shows that you have never seen any terrible men, "

said Kirsánof, with an indulgent smile, thinking to himself,
" I should like to show you Rakhmétof. ”

" But how did you manage all those doctors ? "
" As though it were hard to manage such men ! " said Kir-

sánof, with a slight grimace.
Pólozof recollected Zakhartchenko, who said to the second-

captain , Volutnof : " Did you bring me this lop-eared beast

for me to ride on , your eminence ? I am ashamed to mount
him."
1 Beréïtor.

2 Zhukovsky was the tutor of Alexsander the Second, and the author of many
popular poems ; among others , the national hymn, " God save the Tsar." The Grom.
oboi was the thunderbolt, personified as a horse.


======================================================================

A VITAL QUESTION.

415

After settling all of Pólozof's endlessly repeated questions,
Kirsánof began to suggest to him how he should comport
himself .

" Remember that a person is able to reason only when he
is entirely undisturbed ; that he is not excited only when he
is not stirred up ; that he does not value his fancies except

when they are taken from him, when he is allowed to find
out for himself whether they are good or not. If Sólovtsof
is as bad as you describe him, and I fully believe it, your daughter will see it herself. But only if you don't interfere ; if you don't excite the thought in her mind that you
are in any way intriguing against him, that you are trying
to block them. One word on your part, one hostile word,
will injure the case for two weeks ; a few words may ruin it
forever. You must keep yourself entirely apart."
This course of conduct was inculcated with words like

these : " It isn't easy to compel you to do what you don't
like, is it ? and yet I have brought you to it. This shows
that I understand how to take charge of a case.

Then be-

lieve that whatever I say must be done. Whatever I say ;
you only take it second-hand."
With such people as Pólozof it was impossible at that time,
otherwise than by force, and by stepping on his throat. Pólozof became more amenable to reason, and he promised to
comport himself as he was told. But even after he became
convinced that Kirsánof was saying the right thing, and that
it was necessary to listen to him, Pólozof could not yet comprehend what kind of a man he was .

He at one and the

same time took both his side and his daughter's . He compels him to yield to his daughter, and he wants his daughter
to change ; how to reconcile this ?
" Very simply. I want you not to hinder her return to
reason , and that is all ."
Pólozof wrote Sólovtsof a note , in which he asked him to

come to see him about a very important matter. That
same evening Sólovtsof came ; he made the old man a gentle
explanation , full of self-respect ; he was acknowledged as

" bridegroom," on condition that the wedding should be in
three months


======================================================================

416

A VITAL QUESTION.

VII .

KIRSANOF could not give up the case ; it was necessary to
help Katerina Vasilyevna emerge from her blindness, and it
was still more necessary to manage her father, to keep him
up to his promise of not interfering. But he made it inconvenient to call upon the Polovtsófs, during the first few days
after the crisis . Katerina Vasilyevna was still feeling
exalted; if he saw, as was to be infallibly expected, that
the " bridegroom " was a scoundrel, then, even his silent
dissatisfaction with the " bridegroom," and not alone his
upright and downright opinion, would be prejudicial ; would
still further kindle her excitement.

Kirsánof called there

one morning , after a week and a half, so as not directly
to seek a meeting with the " bridegroom," but to secure
Katerina Vasilyevna's permission. Katerina Vasilyevna
was already beginning to look better ; she was as yet very
thin and pale, but was entirely well, though the former
famous practitioner still prescribed for her , for, when
Kirsánof again put her in his hands, he said, " Ask his
advice ; now none of his medicines will do you any harm,
even if you should take them. "

Katerina Vasilyevna met Kirsánof enthusiastically, and
looked at him with wondering eyes, when he told her what
he had come for .

" You saved my life, and yet you want to ask my permission to call on us ! "

" But my calling upon you, without your consent, while he
is here, might seem to you as an attempt, on my part, to

interfere in your relations, if I came. You know my rule :
not to do anything against the will of a person for whose
benefit I would like to work. "

Kirsánof came on the second or third evening, and found

the " bridegroom" to be exactly what Pólozof described him,
and Pólozof himself, in a proper state of mind; the welltrained old man did not interfere. Kirsánof spent the
evening, giving no sign of what he thought of the " bridegroom," and as he said good night to Katerina Vasilyevna,
he did not hint at all how the bridegroom pleased him.
This was quite enough to wake her curiosity and doubt.
On the next day she kept thinking : " Kirsánof did not say

a word about him. If he had made a good impression on


======================================================================

417

A VITAL QUESTION.

him, Kirsánof would have told me so.

Is it possible that he

didn't please him ? What can there be that Kirsánof
disliked in him? " When the " bridegroom" came in the
evening, she scrutinized his behavior, she pondered over
his words. She said to herself, " What is he doing this
for, " in order to convince herself that Kirsánof had no

right or reason in finding any blemish in him. And she
did convince herself ; but the necessity of proving to yourself that there are no blemishes in the being you love leads
to the quick discovery of such blemishes.

After a few days Kirsánof called again, and again he said
not a word about his impression of the " bridegroom " ; but
this time she could not restrain herself, and at the end of
the evening, she said : -

" Your opinion ? Why are you so silent ? "

" I am afraid that you won't enjoy hearing my opinion ;
I am afraid that you will think that I am partial."
"Don't you like him ? "
Kirsánof did not reply.

" You don't like him, do you ?"
" I did not say so ."

" It is evident. Why don't you like him ? "
" I am going to wait till it is also evident to you why I
don't like him. "

On the following evening Katerina Vasilyevna began to
scrutinize Sólovtsof still more particularly. " Everything
about him is lovely. Kirsánof is not fair; but why can't
I see what there is in him that Kirsánof does not like ? "

She was vexed at her inability to observe.

She asked her-

self, " Am I really so simple ? " Her self-respect was
aroused in her in a direction most dangerous for her bridegroom .

When Kirsánof came again a few days later, he perceived
the possibility of acting more energetically. Till now he
had avoided talk with Sólovtsof, in order to avoid stirring
up Katerina Vasilyevna by a premature interference ; now
he joined the group surrounding her and Sólovtsof, and led
the conversations to topics in which Sólovtsof's character
would be shown forth as soon as he was drawn into the

current. The conversation turned on riches , and it appeared to Katerina Vasilyevna that Sólovtsof was greatly
interested in riches .

The conversation turned upon " bride-

grooms , " and it seemed to her that Sólovtsof spoke rather


======================================================================

418

A VITAL QUESTION.

slightingly about them. The conversation turned upon family life, and she tried in vain to banish from her mind the
impression that possibly it might be cold and hard for a wife
to live with such a husband .

A crisis occurred. Katerina Vasilyevna could not go to
sleep for a long while ; her face was bathed in tears from

being vexed at herself for insulting Sólovtsof with such
thoughts about him. " No, he is not a cold man ; he does
not despise women ; he loves me and not my money." If

these objections had been given as an answer to the words
of somebody else, they would have firmly clung to her
memory. But she objected to her own self, and it is impossible long to resist the truth which you yourself have discovered. It is your own ; you cannot suspect any trickery.
The next evening she examined Sólovtsof just as Kirsánof
had done the evening before. She said to herself that she
only wanted to be convinced that she insulted him without
reason ; but she herself felt that a distrust of him had

sprung up in her. And again she could not sleep, but she
was vexed at him. Why didn't he speak so as to allay her
doubts instead of corroborating them ? She was vexed at
herself, but in her vexation clearly appeared the motive.
" How could I be so blind ! "

Naturally, in a day or two, she began to be exclusively
absorbed by the fear arising from the thought, " I shall soon

lose the possibility of correcting my mistake, if I have been
mistaken in him ."

When Kirsánof came the next time, he saw that he could
speak with her .

" You asked my opinion about him," said he ; " it is not
so important as your own. What do you think of him ?"
Now she had nothing to reply.

" I have no right to be inquisitive," said he; talked about
something else, and soon left her to herself.
But in half an hour she herself came to him.

" Give me some counsel ; you see my thoughts are disturbed ."

" Why do you want the advice of a stranger when you
yourself know what ought to be done when your thoughts
are disturbed ."

" Wait till they cease to be disturbed at al' ? "
" Do according to your best knowledge."
" I shall postpone the wedding."


======================================================================

A VITAL QUESTION.

419

"Why shouldn't you postpone it if it seems to you
better ? "
" But how will he take it ? "

" When you see how he takes it, then you can decide what
is best to be done ."

" But it is hard for me to tell him."

" If that is the case, then let your bátiushka tell him."
" I don't want to get behind anybody's back ; I shall tell
him myself."

" If you feel strong enough to tell him yourself, then it
would be much better."

Of course, with others, Viéra Pavlovna for example, it
would not have done to drag out the affair so tediously ;
but every temperament has its own demands .

If a hot-

tempered man is irritated by slow methods, then a slow man
is vexed by an abrupt measure.

Katerina Vasilyevna's success in dealing with her " bridegroom " exceeded Kirsánof's expectations. He thought that
Sólovtsof would be able to guard his interests, that he
would prolong the matter by humiliation and gentle entreaties .

No, with all his tact, Sólovtsof could not control

himself when he saw that great wealth was slipping out of
his hands , and he himself let go of the slight chances which
he still had. He poured out sharp reproaches on Pólozof,
who he declared was intriguing against him, and he said
to Katerina Vasilyevna that she gave her father too great
power over her, that she was afraid of him, and was acting
now at his command. But Pólozof did not know as yet
about his daughter's decision to delay the wedding ; the
daughter constantly felt that he gave her perfect freedom.
The reproaches heaped upon her father grieved her by their
unfairness, and they insulted her because by them Sólovtsof
expressed his views in regard to her as a being deprived of
will and character.

" It seems to me that you take me to be a plaything in
the hands of others ."

" Yes , " said he in his irritation .

" I was ready to die, not regarding my father's will, and
you don't appreciate it. From this moment everything is
ended between us," said she, and quickly left the room.


======================================================================

420

A VITAL QUESTION.

VIII .

AFTER these occurrences , Katerina Vasilyevna was long melancholy ; but her melancholy, though developed by this state
of things, was not at all attributable to this special state of
things. There are characters to whom a special fact in
itself has very little interest, and serves only to engender
general ideas which act upon them with much greater power.
If such people possess remarkably strong minds, they become reformers nowadays just as in ancient times they
became great philosophers. Kant, Fichte, Hegel, never
worked out private questions ; it was too tedious for them.

This , of course, is true only of men ; women, according to
the prevailing idea, have very little understanding. Nature
did not give it them, just as she did not give a clean face to
blacksmiths , straight backs to tailors, a delicate sense of
smell to shoemakers ; all this is nature.

It is for this rea-

son that there are no women of great intellect. People of
weak minds and with tendency of character become phlegmatic even to apathy. People of ordinary brains are inclined to melancholy, to a quiet life, and are generally imaginative. This does not signify that they are chimerical. In
a good many cases the imagination is weak and they are
very positive people. They simply love a quiet revery.
Katerina Vasilyevna had been in love with Jean Sólovtsof on account of his letters. She was dying with love
founded only on her imagination. It may readily be seen
that she was inclined to be very romantic, and frivolous
life led by the trivial people who frequented Pólozof's house
did not at all dispose her to an exalted idealism. This
shows that this feature of her character arose from her own

nature.

She had long been burdened by the frivolity of

that kind of life ; she loved to read and dream.

And now

she was troubled not only by its frivolity, but by the wealth
with which she was surrounded.

It must not be thought

that because she had this feeling, she had an extraordinary
nature ; it is common among all wealthy women of a humble
and retiring character. In her it developed earlier than
ordinary, simply because she had early received a powerful
lesson .

" Whom shall I believe ?

What shall I believe? " she

asked herself after the episode with Sólovtsof, and it seemed

to her that nobody and nothing were worthy of her faith.
Her father's riches attracted the envious, cunning, deceitful,
from the whole city. She was surrounded by avaricious
men, by liars, by flatterers ; every word that was said to her
was calculated with a view to her father's millions .

Her thoughts kept growing more serious. She began to
get interested in the general questions arising from the
wealth that troubled her so much, as well as in those arising

from the poverty which troubled others. Her father gave
her plenty of pin money, but like any other good woman she
used it in helping the poor. But she read and thought and
began to notice that such help as she could give did less
good than she had reason to expect. She began to see that
she was constantly deceived by feigned or knavish poverty ;
that people worthy of aid, able to make good use of such
money, scarcely ever got any solid good from it ; it lifts them
temporarily out of their poverty, but in half a year or a year
these people are in the same situation again. She began to
think : " Why should money ruin people? Why does this
importunate poverty never leave the poor ? And why are
there so many poor who are as unreasonable and bad as the
rich?"

She was a person of imagination, but her imaginations
were gentle, like her character, and there was just as little
brilliancy about them as there was in herself. Her favorite
author was George Sand, but she never imagined herself to
be Lélia or Indiana or Cavalcanti or Consuélo ; she more
often imagined herself to be Jeannette or Geneviève . Gen-

eviève was her favorite heroine. Here she is going through
the field and is gathering flowers which will serve as models
of her handiwork ; here she meets Andrè

such quiet meet-

ings ! Here they discover that they love cach other ; such
were her imaginations, and she knew that they were only imaginations .

And she loved to dream how enviable was the

lot of Miss Nightingale, that quiet, unostentatious little
woman, of whom scarcely anything was known except that
she was loved by all England. Was she young ? Was she
rich or poor ? Was she happy or unhappy ? About this
nothing is said, about this nothing is thought ; every one
blesses the little woman, who was a ministering angel in the

English hospitals of the Krimea and Skutari, and who at the
end of the war, while returning to her native land with hundreds saved by her, still continued to take care of the sick .

Suchli were the dreams whose fulfilment Katerina Vasilyevna

would have liked to see. Her fancy did not carry her beyond
the thoughts of Geneviève and Miss Nightingale. Can one
say that she was fanciful ? Can one call her imaginative ?
Geneviève in a frivolous, contemptible society of fops and
empty-headed dandies, Miss Nightingale in idle grandeur,
would not they be lonesome ? wouldn't they be melancholy ?
And therefore Katerina Vasilyevna was rather more glad
than sorry when her father failed. She was sorry to see him
who had been so strong growing prematurely old ; she was
sorry also that her ability to help others was curtailed. At
first it was offensive to see the scorn of the crowd which had

crawled and cringed before her and her father. But she was
also glad that this mean, pitiable, wretched crowd had deserted them, had ceased to burden her life, to arouse her

indignation by their falsehood and degradation ; she felt so
free now ! Hopes of happiness arose in her heart. "Now
if any one shows me any devotion, it will be for myself alone,
and not for my father's millions . "

PÓLOZOF was anxious to arrange for the sale of the stearine
factory of which he was part owner and had been the manager . After more than half a year of energetic effort, he

found a purchaser. On the purchaser's visiting-cards was
engraved the name Charles Beaumont, not pronounced Sharl
Bomon, as the ignorant might suppose, but in the true English fashion, Beemont; and it was entirely natural that it
was pronounced so, for the purchaser was the agent of the
London house of Hodgson , Lotter and Company, for the purchase of tallow and stearine. The factory could not exist
under the wretched financial and administrative conduct of
its shareholders ; but in the hands of a solid firm it would be

sure to bring great profits. After spending on it five or six
hundred thousand rubles , the firm could count on having one

hundred thousand rubles of profits. The agent was a conscientious man ; he looked over the factory with great care, and
examined the books in detail before he advised the firm to buy
the property. Then followed negotiations with the stockholders in regard to the selling of the factory. They were excessively long and according to the nature of Russian business

transactions ; even the patient Greeks who spent ten years
in the siege of Troy would have found them tedious. And
Pólozof all this time was with the agent, according to the
old custom of being hospitable to people who are of use, and
he invited him to dinner every day. The agent tried to get
out of his way, and persistently refused to stay to dinner.
But one day, after he had been having an unusually long
session with the directors of the company and was tired and

hungry, he consented to go to dinner with Pólozof, who lived
in a flat in the factory.

Χ.

CHARLES BEAUMONT, like the average Charles , John, James ,
and William, did not care to indulge in intimacies or personal
confidences ; but on being asked, he related his story briefly ,
but very plainly. His family, he said, was from Canada ; and
in Canada almost half the population consisted of the descendants of French colonists ; his family was one of these,
and therefore his name was of French origin, and his face
was more like a Frenchman's than an Englishman's or

Yankee's.

But, he continued, his grandfather emigrated

from the vicinity of Quebec to New York ; it often happened
so . At the time of this emigration his father was a child.

Afterwards, of course, he grew up and became a grown-up
man ; and at this time a certain rich man, with advanced

ideas of agriculture, determined to establish on the southern
shores of the Krimea instead of vineyards a cotton planta-

tion ; he commissioned some one to find him a manager in
North America.

James Beaumont was recommended to him

a Canadian by birth , a resident of New York, and a man
who had all his life been as many versts from a cotton plan-

tation as you or I, reader, who live at Petersburg or Kursk,
have been from Mount Ararat. This is the usual experience
of such progressionists.

It is true that it was not the fault

of the American manager's absolute ignorance of cotton plantations that his plan was ruined, because to plant cotton in
the Krimea is as absurd as it would be to establish vineyards
in Petersburg . And when this was found out, the American

manager was discharged from the cotton plantation, and
found a position as distiller in a factory in the government
of Tambof . Here he lived all his life ; here his son Charles

was born , and soon after that he buried his wife .

When he

was about sixty-five years old, having accumulated a little
money for his declining years, he determined to return to
America, and he left. Charles was then twenty years old.
When his father died, Charles made up his mind to come
back to Russia, because , since he had been born and had

lived twenty years in a village of the government of Tambof,
he felt that he was a Russian .

He had lived with his father

in New York and had been a clerk in a merchant's office .

When his father died, he went to the New York office of the

London firm of Ilodgson, Lotter and Company, because he
knew that this house had business with Petersburg , and after

he had succeeded in making himself useful, he expressed a
desire to get a place in Russia, explaining that he knew
Russia, it being his native land. To have such an agent in
Russia was of course advantageous for the firm; he was
transferred to the London office for a trial, and some six
months before his dinner with Pólozof, he came to Petersburg as an agent for the firm for the purchase of stearine and

tallow, with a salary of five hundred pounds. In perfect
agreement with this tale, Beaumont, who was born and had
lived in the government of Tambof till he was twenty years
old, with only one American or Englishman in a circle of
twenty or fifty or one hundred versts around, with his father,
who had been all day long in the factory ; in conformity with
this tale, Charles Beaumont spoke Russian like a native
Russian , and English fairly well, very well, but not distinctly, as is likely to be the case with a man who has
lived in the land of the English tongue only a few years
after reaching maturity.

XI .

BEAUMONT found himself at the dinner-table, sitting with
only two others, the old man and a very genteel, but somewhat melancholy blondinka, his daughter.
" Did I ever think," said Pólozof at dinner, " that the

sares in this factory would ever have such importance for
me ? It is hard for a man of my years to have such a shock
come upon him, but it is good that Kátya cares so little that
I have lost her fortune ; for, even while I live, it is more her

property than mine : her mother had property, and I had

little. Of course I made every ruble grow into twenty ; it
shows that, on the other hand, it grew more from my labor
than by inheritance ; and how hard I worked ! and how
much one has to know ! " The old man talked long in this
self-flattering tone. " And everything was gained by my
sweat and blood, but most of all by my brains," he said in
conclusion, and he repeated what he said at first : that such

a shock was very hard to bear, and that if Katya too were
worried by it , it seemed to him that he would lose his senses ;

but Kátya not only does not worry, but even consoles him.
Either according to the American custom of not seeing

anything extraordinary in a rapid accumulation of wealth,
or in a failure , or because it was his natural character, Beau-

mont had no desire either to be overpowered by the greatness of the mind that could make three or four millions, or
to feel great concern for the failure which left sufficient

means to allow the maintenance of a good cook ; but nevertheless it was necessary to offer some consolation after this

long speech, and therefore he said, " Yes, it is a great solace when a family faces its troubles courageously."
" Yes ? you speak rather doubtfully, Karl Yakovlitch.
You think that Katya is melancholy on account of her lost

riches ? No, Karl Yakovlitch, no ; you judge her unfairly ;
she and I have a different trouble ; she and I have lost our

confidence in men," said Pólozof in that half-jesting, half-

serious tone in which old and experienced people speak of
the good and inexperienced thoughts of their children.
Katerina Vasilyevna blushed; it was disagreeable to her
that her father turned the conversation to her feelings : but
besides her father's love there was another certain circumstance , for which her father was not to blame ; if there is

nothing to talk about, and there happens to be in the room a

cat or a dog, the conversation will seize upon the animal ;
and if there is no cat or dog, then it goes to the children .

The weather is the third and the extremity of resourcelessness .
" No, papa, it is hardly necessary to explain my melancholy by any motive so high ; you know that I have a reserved nature , and I am lonesome . "

" One need not be melancholy unless he pleases," said
Beaumont ; "but to be bored is in my opinion unpardonable. Loneliness is a fashion among our brethren, the English, but we Americans know nothing about it ; we have no

time to be melancholy. We have too much to do to allow of

it, I think ; I mean, it seems to me " (he corrected his Americanism) " that the Russian people ought to see themselves
in the same situation : according to my way of looking at
it, they too have too much to do ; but, in reality, I see exactly the opposite in the Russians ; they are very much disposed to reserve. Even the English cannot equal them in
this respect. Englishmen are known all over Europe, including Russia, to be the most gloomy people in the world,
but they are as much more sociable, lively, and gay than the
Russians, as they themselves are behind the French in this
respect, and your tourists tell you how reserved English
society is . I don't understand where their eyes are when
they look at themselves."
"And the Russians are right in being gloomy," said Katerina Vasilyevna ; " what chance do they have for activity ?
They have nothing to do ! They have to sit and fold their
hands. Give me something to do, and the chances are that
I shall not be melancholy."
" You want to find something to do ? Oh, there ought not
to be any obstacle to that ; you see all around you such ignorance ; excuse me for speaking so about your country, about

your futherland" (again he corrected his Anglicism) ; " but
I was born here myself, and grew up here ; I look upon it as
my own, and therefore I don't stand upon ceremony ; you
see in it genuine Turkish ignorance, Chinese helplessness .
' I detest your fatherland because I love it as my own,' I will
say, imitating your poet ; but there are great opportunities."
" Yes, but what can a man, much less , what can a woman ,
do?"

"But you are doing something, Kátya," said Pólozof.- “ І

am going to expose her secret, Karl Yakovlitch. She teaches
little girls because she hasn't anything else to do. Every
day she has her pupils, and she is busy with them from ten
o'clock till one , and sometimes even longer . "

Beaumont looked up at Katerina Vasilyevna with respect.
" This is our style in America ; of course by America I
mean only the Northern free States . The Southern States are
worse than Mexico, almost as bad as Brazil. "

was an ardent abolitionist.

Beaumont

" This is in our style," he re-

peated ; " and if this is so, why be lonesome ? "

" Is this a serious undertaking, Mr. Beaumont ? It seems
to me merely a recreation; perhaps I may be mistaken ;
maybe you will call me a materialist."


======================================================================

A VITAL QUESTION.

427

" Do you expect such a reproach from a man belonging to
a nation whose sole aim and thought, as every one asserts,
is dollars ? "

" Those are idle words, but I really fear to express my
opinion ; it may seem analogous to what the obskurants are
agitating about the uselessness of education . "

" Now I see, ¹ " thought Beaumont ; " has she really come
to that ? This is getting interesting.- I myself am an obskurant, " said he ; " I am in favor of the illiterate colored

people against their civilized owners in the Southern States .
Excuse me ; I am drawn away by my American prejudices ;
but I am very curious to know your opinion."
" It is very prosaic, Mr. Beaumont, but life brought me
to it. It seems to me that the thing that I am doing is too
one- sided ; and that side to which it is directed is not the

most important side, if those who want to do good to the
people want really to do the best for them ; this is what I

think : give men bread, and they themselves will get education. It is necessary to begin with bread ; otherwise, we
are simply wasting our time.”
" Then why don't you begin where you ought to begin ? "
asked Beaumont, in a somewhat excited manner. " It is
possible that I know instances at home in America," he
added.

" I told you that I was alone, and what can I do ? I don't
know how to begin; and if I did know, what chance have I ?
A girl is tied in every way.

I am not independent even in

my own room. What can I do in my room ? Lay a book
down on the table, and teach children how to read. Where
can I go alone by myself ? Whom can I see alone ? What
action can I take by myself ? "
" It seems to me that you represent me as a despot,
Kátya, " said her father.

" I am not to blame in this case ,

and have not been since you taught me my lesson."
" Papa, I am still blushing for that ; I was only a child
then. No, papa, you are kind ; you don't restrain me ; it is
society that restrains. Is it true, Mr. Beaumont, that a girl
in America is freer in her actions ? "

" Yes ; we have that to be proud of.

To be sure, we are

far from being what we ought to be ; but still, what a comparison between us and you Europeans ! All that you have
been told about the emancipation of women there, is true."

A VITAL QUESTION.

" Papa, let us go to America, as soon as Mr. Beaumont
has bought your factory," said Katerina Vasilyevna, gayly.
“

There I should accomplish something. Akh ! how happy

I should be ! "

" One can find something to do in Petersburg, " said
Beaumont.

" I should like to see it."

Beaumont hesitated two or three seconds . "Why did I
come here ? " he asked himself ; " who would be better to

find out for me ? - Haven't you heard? An experiment has
been tried of putting into practice the principles of political
economy, which have recently been established ; do you
know them ? "

" Yes , I have read about them. It must be very interesting and profitable ; and I can take a part in them. Where
can I find them ? "

" It was established by a Mrs. Kirsánova."
" Who is she ?

Is her husband a doctor ? "

" Do you know him ? And didn't he tell you about this
experiment ? ”

" I knew him long before he was married. I was very
ill ; he called on us several times , and saved me.
what a fine man he is !

Akh !

Is she like him ? "

But how could she get acquainted with Mrs. Kirsánova ?

Will Beaumont give Katerina Vasilyevna a letter to Mrs.
Kirsánova ?

No ; the Kirsánofs had never even heard his

name, but no introduction is necessary. Mrs. Kirsánova
will certainly be glad to meet such sympathy. Her address
can easily be found where Kirsánof is employed.
XII .

Ir thus came about that Miss Pólozova became acquainted

with Viéra Pavlovna. She went to see her the very next
morning ; and Beaumont was so much interested, that he
came back in the evening to find out how Katerina Vasilyevna liked her new acquaintance and the new enterprise .
Katerina Vasilyevna was greatly inspired. Her melancholy had entirely disappeared ; her dreaminess had given
way to enthusiasm. She eagerly related to Beaumont-and
she had already told her father, but once telling of it was
not enough- what she had seen that morning, and there


======================================================================

429

seemed to be no end to her story ; yes , now her heart was

full. She had found a lively enterprise. Beaumont listened
to her attentively; but can one be satisfied with listening
only? And she said, almost with vexation, " Mr. Beaumont, I am disappointed in you. Does it have so little
effect on you, that it only interests you, and nothing more ? "
" Katerina Vasilyevna, you forget that I have scen all
this at home in America ; some of the details may be inter-

esting to me ; but the enterprise itself is too familiar to me.
Only the people who carry it on with such success are of
interest to me, while to you the thing is a novelty. For
instance, what can you tell me about Madame Kirsánova ? "
" Akh ! Bozhe moi ! Of course I liked her very much
indeed. She was so lovely in describing everything to me."
" You told me that before ."

" What else do you want ? What more can I tell you ?
What attention could I give to her when I had such a novel

thing before my eyes ? "
" That is so," said Beaumont ; " I understand we entirely
forget about persons when we are interested in things ; however, can't you tell me something else about Madame Kirsánova ? "

Katerina Vasilyevna tried to gather all her recollections

about Viéra Pavlovna, but she could only bring back the
first impression which Viéra Pavlovna made upon her ; she

gave a very lively picture of her personal appearance, her
way of speaking, all, in fact, that the eye takes in when
meeting a stranger for the first time ; but further, there was

absolutely nothing in her recollections of Viéra Pavlovna
that was of special interest : it was her work-shop, workshop, work-shop, and Viéra Pavlovna's explanations about
the work-shop. She understood the explanations perfectly,
but Viéra Pavlovna herself, from the time that followed their
first meeting, made no impression upon her.

" And so this time I am disappointed in my expectations
in learning about Madame Kirsánova ; but I am not going to
give you up ; in a few days I shall ask you again about her. "
" But why don't you yourself make her acquaintance, if

she interests you so?"
" I should like to do so ; maybe I will do so some time.

But before , I must learn more about her. " - Beaumont was

silent for a moment. " I was wondering whether to ask you
or not ; but it seems better to ask you, if you should happen


======================================================================

430

A VITAL QUESTION.

to mention my name in your conversation with her, please
don't tell her that I have made any inquiries about her, or
that I want to make her acquaintance some time ."

" That's very mysterious , Mr. Beaumont," said Katerina
Vasilyevna in a serious tone .

" You want to find out about

them, and yet you yourself want to be concealed. "
" Yes , Katerina Vasilyevna ; how can I explain that to
you? I am afraid to make their acquaintance."
" This is very strange, Mr. Beaumont. "
" It is true. I will speak plainer ; I am afraid that it
would be disagreeable to her. They have never heard my
name . But I might have had some intercourse with some of
the people that are friends of theirs , or even with themselves ;
it is all the same . In a word, I must know first whether it
would be agreeable to them to make my acquaintance. "
" All this is strange, Mr. Beaumont. "
" I am an honest man , Katerina Vasilyevna ; let me assure

you that I would never think of putting you into a false
position ; this is only the second time that I have ever seen
you, but I have a great respect for you."
" I also see, Mr. Beaumont, that you are a man worthy of
respect , but — "

" If you think that I am a man worthy of respect, you will
allow me to call upon you, so that when you know me well
enough, I can ask you again about the Kirsánofs. Or ,

rather, you will speak about them yourself when it will seem
to you that you can fulfil my request which I shall make
now, and which I shall not repeat. Do you agree ? "
" All right, Mr. Beaumont," said Katerina Vasilyevna,
slightly shrugging her shoulders . " But you must confess
that- "

Again she did not want to finish her sentence .

" That my action seems rather suspicious ? True ; but I
will wait till you get over your suspicions."
XIII .

BEAUMONT got into the way of making frequent calls at the

Pólozofs' . " Why not ? " thought the old man. " He is an
excellent match. Of course in other days Kátya could have
had a better husband.

But even then she did not care for

money or for flattery.

And now nothing better could be

desired ."


======================================================================

` A VITAL QUESTION.

Indeed , Beaumont was an excellent match .

431

He said that

he intended to live the rest of his life in Russia because he

looked upon it as his native land.

He was a man of charac-

ter ; he was thirty years old, a self-made man ; and he had
a good situation. If he had been a Russian, Pólozof would
have liked him to belong to the nobility. But as he was a
foreigner, this was of no consequence, especially as he was of
French origin , and, above all, an American citizen. Among the
Americans, a man who may be to-day a journeyman shoemaker, or a plowman, to-morrow will be a general, and the
next day president ; and after that he may be a lawyer , or
in a counting-house. It is a peculiar people altogether ; they
care only for a man's money or his brains. This is the right
way of looking at it," continued Pólozof. " I myself am
that kind of man .

I entered mercantile life ; I married a

merchant's widow. The main thing is money, and brains ,
because without brains you can't get any money. And this
man is on the road to it. He will buy the factory, will
become manager ; then the firm will take him as a partner.
And their firms are not like ours .

He too will roll in his

millions ."

It is very possible that Pólozof's imagination about his
son-in-law becoming a millionaire in the commercial line

will not be realized any more than Marya Alekséyevna's imaginations in regard to her chosen son-in-law becoming
a great monopolist were realized. But for all that, Beaumont

was an excellent match for Katerina Vasilyevna.
But, after all, was not Pólozof mistaken in thinking that
Beaumont was going to be his son-in-law? If the old man
had a shadow of a doubt about this , it vanished when Beaumont, in the course of a fortnight, said to him, that the pur-

chase of the factory might be delayed for several days, the
delay was unavoidable ; even if Mr. Lotter were not coming,

it would take at least a week to bring it to a conclusion, and
Mr. Lotter would not be in Petersburg for a week. " Before

I was personally acquainted with you," said Beaumont, " I
wanted to finish the business myself. Now it would not
look well, because we are so well acquainted.

In order that

there should be no misunderstanding by and by, I have
written about it to the firm to this effect : that during the
business transaction I have made the acquaintance of the
manager whose whole property is invested in the factory,
1 Literally, to be a noble (dvoryanin) .


======================================================================

432

A VITAL QUESTION.

and I asked the firin to send some one to conclude the

bargain in my place, and now, as you see, Mr. Lotter is
coming."

Shrewd and clever ! At the same time it shows plainly
Beaumont's intention of marrying Katya ; a mere acquaintance would not be sufficient reason to take such a careful
step.
XIV .

For the next two or three visits Beaumont was met very

coolly by Katerina Vasilyevna. In truth, she began to feel
a certain distrust in this person with whom her acquaintance
was so slight, and who expressed a puzzling desire to learn
about a family where he was not acquainted, and at the same
time, according to his own words, he feared to become acquainted because he feared that his acquaintance might not
be agreeable there. But although Katerina Vasilyevna met
him suspiciously during these first calls, yet she was soon
drawn into a lively conversation with him. In her former
life , before she had ever known Kirsánof, she had never met

such a man ; he was so sympathetic in regard to all that interested her ; he understood her so well, even among her
dearest friends - by the way, there was only one who was
a real friend, Paulina, who had long ago moved to Moscow,
and there married a Muscovite manufacturer, and even with
Paulina she could not speak with as much ease as with him.
And he , at first he came not so much on her account as

for the purpose of learning through her about the Kirsánofs ;
but from the very beginning of their acquaintance, from the
very moment when they spoke about melancholy and the
means of curing it, it could be seen that he respected her,
that he sympathized with her. At his second call he was

still more attracted to her by her enthusiam at finding a new
field of activity. Now, with every new meeting, his inclination to her was more and more evident to her. Very soon
there arose between them most simple and friendly relations .

At the end of a week Katerina Vasilyevna told him about
the Kirsánofs ; she was sure that this man could have no unworthy thoughts .

It is true that when she began to speak about the Kirsánofs ,
he stopped her : " Why so soon? You know me too
slightly."


======================================================================

433

A VITAL QUESTION,

" No ; sufficiently, Mr. Beaumont ; I see that if you did
not want to explain to me what seemed strange in your
desire, you must have had good reason ; and there are so
many mysteries in this world. "

And he replied, " You see that I have no longer that
great impatience to know what I wanted to know about
them . "
XV.

KATERINA VASÍLYEVNA's enthusiasm continued without dimi-

nution, but changed into a constant, habitual mood, earnest,
eager, and bright. And, as it seemed to her, this enthusiasm drew Beaumont closer to her. And he thought a great

deal about her ; this was sufficiently apparent.

Having

heard two or three times what she had to tell about the

Kirsánofs , on the fourth time he said : " I now know everything that I wanted to know about them.

Thank you."

" But what do you know ? I only told you that they love
each other, and are perfectly happy in their married life."
" More than that I did not care to know. However, all
that I knew already."
The conversation turned on something else.

Of course Katerina Vasilyevna's first thought was when he
asked about Mrs. Kirsánova, that he was in love with Viéra

Pavlovna. But no ; it was perfectly evident that such was
not the case. So far as Katerina Vasilyevna was able to
judge him now, she thought that Beaumont was not even
able to fall in love. Truly, to love was in his power ; that
is true. But if he loves any one now, it is I," thought
Katerina Vasilyevua.
XVI .

But the main thing was, did they love each other ? Let
us begin with her. There was one case when she showed
some solicitude about Beaumont ; but how did this case end ?

Quite otherwise from what might have been expected at the
beginning. Beaumont got into the habit of calling at the
Pólozofs' literally every day, sometimes making longer calls
than at others, but every day just the same . And this
caused Pólozof to think that he was going to offer himself to
Katerina Vasilyevna ; he had no other foundations for such

a belief. But one evening it happened that Beaumont did
not come . " You don't know what is the matter with him,

do you, papa ? "
" I have not heard ; I guess there is nothing the matter.
He probably did not have time."
A second evening passed, and still there was no Beaumont. On the following morning, Katerina Vasilyevna was
evidently going somewhere.
" Where are you going.
Kátya?"
" Somewhere , papa, on my own business." She went to
find about Beaumont. He was sitting in his wide-sleeved

overcoat, and was reading ; he lifted his eyes from the book
when the door opened.

" Katerina Vasilyevna, is this you? I am very glad and
very grateful to you," he said in the same tone as he would
have addressed her father ; possibly the tone was a little
more cordial.

" What is the matter, Mr. Beaumont, that you have not

been to see us for so long? You made me worry about you,
and besides , you made me feel my lonesomeness. "
" It was nothing particular, Katerina Vasilyevna ; as you

see, I am well. Won't you take some tea with me? You
see I am just having mine."
" Of course I will ; but why have you stayed away from
us so long ? "
" Piotr, bring a glass . You see I am well ; a mere trifle ;
this is the reason : I was at the factory with Mr. Lotter ,
and while I was explaining something to him, I was rather
careless ; and putting my arm on a screw, it turned around
and scratched my arm through the sleeve, and so I have not

been able to put on my coat for the last three days. "
" Let me see it ; else I shall be worried lest it is not a
scratch , but a serious wound. "
" Yes , it must be a big one ' (here Piotr comes in with
‫دو‬

a glass for Katerina Vasilyevna) -" when I make use of
both my hands. However, I will show it to you." He
rolled up his sleeve to the elbow.

" Piotr , throw the ashes

out of the tray, and give me my cigar-holder ; it's on the
library table. See, it is a mere trifle ; nothing but an
English plaster was necessary. "

" Yes ; but there is still some swelling, and it is inflamed."
" Yesterday there was considerably more, and by to-morrow there will be none at all ."

Piotr, after cleaning out the ash-tray and bringing the
cigar-holder, leaves the room.
" I did not want to appear before you as a wounded
hero."

" Why didn't you write me, then ? "
" Da ! I thought that I should be able to put on my coat
right away ; that is, day before yesterday ; and day before
yesterday, I expected to put it on yesterday ; and yesterday,
to-day. I thought it was not worth while to worry you."
" Yes , and you have worried me all the more . It was not

nice of you , Mr. Beaumont. And when shall you finish this
business of yours ? "
" Da ! probably in a day or two ; the delay is not our
fault. Mr. Lotter and I are all ready, but it is the stockholders ."

" And what have you been reading ? "
" A new novel by Thackeray. How can a man write
himself out so when he has such a talent !

It is because his

fund of ideas is getting low."
" I have read it ; it is quite true."

And she went on to

speak of Thackeray's failing powers. Then they so spoke
about half an hour on various other topics in the very same

" How old is he ? "

" Six years , sir. "

Beaumont ; will you come to-day ? "
" Hardly likely , no ; to-morrow, sure. "

DOES it ever happen that people do such things? Do
young girls who are in love ever make such visits ? Not to
speak of the fact that no well-trained young lady would
allow herself to do such a thing ; but if she did, the conversation would be quite different.

If the action performed by

Katerina Vasilyevna was contrary to morality, then still
more contrary to the generally accepted ideas as to the relations between men and young women , would be the character, so to speak , of this immoral action. Isn't it clear that
Katerina Vasilyevna and Beaumont were not human beings ,

but fish ? and if they were human beings, that they had the
blood of fishes in their veins ? The way that she usually
behaved towards him in her own house, also absolutely corresponded with this theory .

" I am too tired to talk, Mr. Beaumont," she used to say
when he stayed late. " You stay with papa, but I am going
to bed " ; and she used to leave him.

Sometimes he used to reply, " Stay quarter of an hour
more , Katerina Vasilyevna. "
" All right," she would say in such cases ; but more often
he replied, " Then good by, Katerina Vasilyevna."
What kind of people are these , I should like to know ; and

I should like to know if they are not simply excellent people,
whose meetings are disturbed by nobody, who are free to
see each other when and as much as they please, whose marriage no one will hinder as soon as they make up their minds ,
and who , therefore , have no reason to be possessed of devils .
But still I am vexed at their cool treatment of each other,
and I am not as much ashamed for them as for myself. Is

it really my fate as a novelist, to compromise in the eyes of
all well-bred readers , all my heroes and heroines ? Some of
them eat and drink ; others are not possessed of devils without cause ; what uninteresting people !
XVIII .

MEANTIME , So far as the old man Pólozof could judge, the
affair was coming to a marriage. When the probable bride
and probable bridegroom were getting to be so intimate,

======================================================================

A VITAL QUESTION.

it was evident that there would be a marriage.

437

Has he

not heard their talk ? To be sure, his daughter and the
probable bridegroom were not always under his eyes. More
often than not they would sit by themselves or walk together
by themselves ; but this did not change in the least the
tenor of their conversations .

Even the shrewdest student

of the human heart would have never suspected, had he
heard them talk, that Beaumont would marry Katerina
Vasilyevna.

Not that they never spoke about their feel-

ings. They spoke about them as they spoke about everything else in the world ; but they said excessively little
about them ; and even this little counted as nothing from
the tone in which they spoke. The tone was vexatious

from its very calmness, and what they said would have
seemed terribly absurd to any one in society. Now, for
example, it happened that in about a week after the visit for
which Beaumont was so grateful to Katerina Vasilyevna, and
in about two months after their acquaintance had begun , the

sale of the factory was accomplished. Mr. Lotter was intending to leave on the following day. (And he left ; don't
imagine that he is going to bring a catastrophe. He, as is
common with business men in transacting commercial operations , told Beaumont that the firm would make him the man-

ager of the factory, at the salary of a thousand pounds , as
might have been expected, and nothing more. What need
had he , as a business man, to interfere with Beaumont's love

affairs ?) The shareholders , including Pólozof, were to receive, on the following day (and they did receive all that
they expected. Here, again, you must not expect a catastrophe ; for the firm of Hodgson, Lotter and Company is a
very reliable one) half in ready cash, and half in notes payable
in three months .

Pólozof, full of satisfaction at this turn of

affairs , was sitting at his table in the reception-room, and
was counting over the banknotes. He overheard in part
the conversation that was going on between his daughter and
Beaumont, as they passed through the reception-room. They
were walking through the four rooms of the flat that faced
on the street .

" If a woman, a girl , is embarrassed with prejudices ," said
Beaumont (not committing any Americanisms or Anglicisms) ,
" then a man- I speak of respectable men- is subject to
great inconveniences on that account. Tell me , how can one
marry a girl who has not been trained in the simple duties of

life, who does not realize what relations may arise after she
has accepted an offer ? She may not be able to judge whether
she will enjoy her life with the man who is to be her husband."

" But , Mr. Beaumont, if her relations to this man are of a

sincere character, such as they had been before he proposed
to her, then I think that this would be some guarantee that
they wouldbe contented with each other."
" Some guarantee, certainly ; but it would be much surer
if the trial were longer and more thorough. She cannot
know in any way the character of the relation into which she
is going to enter ; and so marriage is for her a terrible risk.

So much for her; and the honorable man who is to marry
her has to run the same risk . He can gencrally judge whether

he will be satisfied. He knows intimately women of various
natures ; he has made trial of what nature suits him the best.
She has not that chance ."
" But she can observe the lives and characters of those in

her own family and in the families of her friends ; she can
think a great deal. "
"All that is good, so far as it goes, but it is not sufficient.
Nothing can take the place of a personal trial . "

" Would you have only widows get married? " asked KaterinaVasilyevna, laughing .

" You have expressed yourself quite to the point.
widows ; girls should be prohibited from marrying."

Only

" That is true,” said Katerina Vasilyevna, seriously.

Such talk as this seemed very wild to Pólozof at first, as
he caught fragments of it. But graduallyhe got accustomed
to the thought, and he said to himself, " Well, I myself am
a man without prejudices. I started in business, and I, too,
married a widow, a merchant's widow. ”
What he heard was only a little episode in their conversation, which was also devoted to other affairs ; but on the fol-

lowing day this subject of their yesterday's conversation was
continued in this way : -

" You have told me the story of your love for Sólovtsof.

But what was it?

It was

" Let us sit down, if it is just the same to you ; I am tired
ofwalking."
" Very well.

or, rather, to feel gloomy about ; for it certainly has its mel-

ancholy side.

439

You were saved only by a strange and rare

piece of good fortune, because your case fell into the hands
of a man like Aleksandr ."
" Who ? "

"Aleksandr Matvéitch Kirsánof," he added, as though not

to say merely his first name. " If it had not been for Kirsánof, you would have died, either by consumption or by
that wretch. One can draw very sensible conclusions about
the unhappy position that you held in society. You yourself
have drawn such conclusions . All this is good enough, and
it has only in the end made you a far more sensible and ex-

cellent girl ; but it did not in the slightest degree give you
any further experience for making up your mind what sort
of a man would satisfy you as a husband."
" Not a miserable but an honorable man ; that is all that

you can decide. So far so good ; but would it be enough for
any honorable woman to know that the character of the man
that she had chosen for her husband was honorable, if she

did not know him any more than that ? It is necessary to
have a more exact knowledge of a man's character ; that is,
you must have a very different experience from what you
have already had. We decided yesterday that according to
your expression it is only widows who should be allowed to
marry. But what sort of a widow are you ? "

All this was said by Beaumont in a tone expressing dissatisfaction, and his last words were spoken actually in a
grieved tone.
" That is true ,” said Katerina Vasilyevna rather gloomily,
" for all that, I could not be easily deceived ."

"And you could not if you tried, because it is impossible
to affect experience if you have it not."
" You are always speaking about the lack of ways that we
girls have for making a satisfactory choice. As a general
thing it is absolutely true ; but there are exceptional cases
when so much experience is not necessary for making a sat-

isfactory choice. If a girl is not so very young, she may
understand her own character very well. For instance, I
know my character, and it is evident to me that it is not
going to change. I am twenty-two years old. I know what
is necessary for my happiness : to live quietly so as not to be
stirred up, that is all. "
" That is true.

That is evident ."

" And is it so very hard to see whether this man or that

440

A VITAL QUESTION.

has the marks of character sufficient to satisfy this want?
This can be seen in a few conversations . "

" That is true ; but you said that this is an exceptional
case. The general rule is different ."
" Of course the rule is different. But, Mr. Beaumont, in

the conditions of our lives , according to our understandings
and habits , it is impossible to wish that a girl should have
the knowledge of those every-day relations about which we
were speaking, while without it, in most cases, a girl runs
the risk of making an unsatisfactory choice. Her position is
inextricable under present conditions. As things are now,
let her enter into whatever relations she pleases ; it will in no
case give her experience : she might not get any advantage ,

and her dangers would be vastly multiplied. A girl can
easily lower herself, can learn wickedness and deceit. She
would be obliged to deceive her friends and society, to hide
from their eyes, and from this there is an easy transition to
falsehood, which is sure to ruin her character.

It is even

very possible that she may learn to look superficially upon
life. And if this should not result, yet if she is going to be
agood woman, then her heart may be broken. In the mean
time, she will gain nothing in the experience of every day's

life, because these relations which are so dangerous to her
character or so tormenting to her heart are theatrical, idle,
and out of the ordinary. You see that it is impossible to
advise in the conditions of our life ."

“ Of course, Katerina Vasilyevna ; but for that very reason
our life is bad ."

" Yes , indeed, we are agreed on that point."
" What does this mean ? Leaving out the fact that the
deuce knows what it means, what has it to do with their personal relations ? The man says, ' I doubt whether you will
make me a good wife ' ; and the girl replies, ' Just make me
an offer and see ! '

" What extraordinary impertinence ! Or is it not so, perhaps ? Maybe the man says : ' I have no need of question-

ing whether I am going to be happy with you ; but be careful
even though you choose me. You have chosen me, but I beg
of you , think, think carefully. This is a very serious matter.
Don't put your confidence even in me, who love you so

dearly, without a serious and attentive making up of your
mind.'

" And maybe the girl answers : ' My friend, I see that you

A VITAL QUESTION.

441

think not about yourself, but about me. It is your truthfulness ; we are to be pitied, we are deceived, we are lead

blindfolded. so as to be more easily deceived. But don't
fear on my account ; you cannot deceive me . My happiness
is sure. Just as you are tranquil on your part, so am I on
mine .'"

" I wonder at one thing," continued Beaumont on the following day. Again they were walking through the rooms ,
and Pólozof was sitting in one of them.

" I wonder at one

thing- that there are any happy marriages under such conditions ."

" You speak in a tone as though you were sorry that there
were such things as happy marriages," replied Katerina

Vasilyevna laughingly. She now, as may have been observed,
laughs frequently in a tranquil and joyous way.
" And in fact they generally do inspire gloomy thoughts :
if with such scanty means of judging the necessities and
characters of men, girls very often succeed in making satisfactory choices, what a brightness and soundness of wit it
shows that women possess ! What a true, strong, vigilant
mind nature has gifted them withal ! And this mind remains
without advantage for society, society dismisses it, oppresses

it, chokes it, and the history of mankind would have advanced tenfold quicker if this intellect had not been dismissed, oppressed, and killed. "
" You are the panegyrist of women, Mr. Beaumont ! Is

there no way of explaining it in a simpler way, by opportunity ?"

" By opportunity ? Explain it by opportunity if you want
to ; but when the opportunities are numerous, you know that
besides chance which originates one part of them, there must
be another cause originating the other part. It is impossible
to suppose any other general cause, beyond my explanation
-soundness of choice arising from the strength and vigilance
of mind ."

" You are quite like Mrs. Beecher Stowe, on the woman
question , Mr. Beaumont.

She proves that the negroes are

the most talented of all the races, that they stand above the
white race by their intellect."
" You are joking, but I am serious ."

" It seems that you are provoked at me because I don't
bow before a woman.

But accept as my excuse at least the

difficulty of getting on my knees before myself. "


======================================================================

442

A

VITAL QUESTION.

" Joke ! but I am seriously provoked."
" But not at me, I hope ? I am not in the least to blame
for the fact that women and girls cannot accomplish what is

necessary according to your opinion. However, if you
want, I will tell you seriously what I think only not on the
woman question : I don't want to be a judge in my own
case, but exclusively about you, Mr. Beaumont. You are a
man of reserved nature, but you get excited when you speak
on this subject. What should follow from this ? The fact
that you must have some personal interest in this question .
Evidently you must have suffered from some mistake in the

choice made by a girl who was , as you say, inexperienced."
" Maybe I, maybe somebody else who was nearer me.
However, consider, Katerina Vasilyevna.

I shall tell you

when I hear your answer. I shall ask your answer in three
days."
" To a question which has not been asked? Do I know

you so little as to be compelled to think three days ? " Katerina Vasilyevna stopped, put her arm around Beaumont's
neck , drew his head towards her , and kissed his forehead .
According to all the examples of the past, and according

to the demands of propriety itself, Beaumont would have to
take her in his arms and kiss her lips ; but he did no such
thing, but only pressed her hand, which had dropped down
from his head. " Yes, Katerina Vasilyevna, still think the
matter over. " And they began to walk again.
" But who told you, Charlie, that I have been thinking
about it for more than three days ? " she replied, not letting
go his hand.
" Yes , of course, I saw it ; but still I will tell you now, -

I have a secret ; let us go to that room, and sit down there,
so that he can't hear."

The end of this began to take place when they passed the
old man. The old man saw that they were walking hand in
hand, which had never happened to them before, and he

thought : " He has asked her hand, and she has promised.
Good!"

" Tell me your secret, Charlie ; papa will not hear from
there ."

" It seems absurd, Katerina Vasilyevna that I appear to be
afraid of you ; of course there is nothing to be afraid of. But
you will understand why I caution you when I tell you that
I have an example in mind. Of course you see that we

shall be able to live together; but I pitied her. How much
she suffered , and how long she was deprived of life which

was necessary to her ! It was pitiful ; I saw with my own
eyes. Where it was makes no difference - New York, Boston , Philadelphia- you know - it's no matter ; but she was
a very excellent woman, and she looked upon her husband
as an excellent man. They were exceedingly attached to
each other ; yet, still she had to suffer a great deal. He
was ready to give his life for the least increase of her happiness , but, for all that, she could not live happily with him .
It was well that it ended as it did, but it was hard for her.

You have not experienced any such thing , and so I shall not
accept your answer. "

" Could I hear this story from anybody ? "
" Perhaps so .”
" From the woman herself ? "

" Perhaps so."

" And I have not given you any answer yet? "
" No."

" Do you know what it will be ? "

" I do," said Beaumont, and then began an ordinary
scene , proper between " bridegroom " and " bride," with
kisses .

XIX .

On the next day at three o'clock Katerina Vasilyevna
went to Viéra Pavlovna.

" I am to be married day after to-morrow, Viéra Pavlovna, " she said as she entered ; " and this evening I am
going to bring my bridegroom to see you."
" Beaumont, of course, whom you have been crazy over
this long time."
" I, crazy ? When everything passed off so quietly and
reasonably ! "
" I thoroughly believe that you talked with him very
quietly and sensibly ; but with me, quite otherwise."
" Really, this is interesting ! But here is something more

interesting : he loves you very much-both of you ; but you,
Viéra Pavlovna, much more than Aleksandr Matvéitch."

" Is there anything interesting in that? If you have
spoken to him about me with a thousandth part of the

‫دو‬

then, of course --

" Do you think that he knows you through me ? Here's
where the fun comes in, that he knows you personally, not
through me, but far better than I do."
" That's news !

How is that?

" How ? I am going to tell you right away. The very
first day that he came to Petersburg he was very anxious to
see you , but it seemed to him that it would be better to postpone the acquaintance till he should come to you, not by
himself, but with a bride ' or a wife. It seemed to him

that it would be pleasanter for you to see him with a wife
than single. You see that our engagement came about
through his desire to make your acquaintance."

" He marries you so as to get acquainted with me ! "
" The idea ! who says that he marries me for your sake ?
Oh, no ! we get married, of course, not from love to you.
But did we know of each other's existence until he came to

Petersburg , and if he had not come, how should we have got

acquainted ? But he came to Petersburg for your sake !
How absurd you are ! "
" Does he speak Russian better than English ? " asked
Viéra Pavlovna , in excitement.

" IIe speaks Russian just as I do, and English just as I
do ."

" My dear Kátenka, how glad I am ! " Viéra Pavlovna
threw her arms around her guest.- " Sasha, come here !

hurry, hurry ! "
" What is it, Viérotchka ? How d'ye do, Katerina Vas- "
He had no chance to speak her whole name before the

young lady was kissing him.
" To-day is Easter, Sasha. Say to Kátenka, ' Indeed, he
is risen . ' '' 1

" But what is this all about? "

" Sit down, and she will tell you everything. And I myself have not heard all I want about it. That'll do ; you
have had enough kisses ! and before me too ! Now tell us,
Kátenka ! "
1 On Easter Sunday, which comes in Russia twelve days later than in the West,
it is the custom among the people, especially among the peasantry, when they meet,
to say, " Kristos voskres " (Christ is risen) , to which the answer is made, " Voïstinu
voskres " (He is risen indeed) . It is also permissible to bestow kisses promiscuously ,
andmany avail themselves of this privilege wherever a pretty girl gives them oссаsion . The Russian peasant believes that Christ is actually on earth during the six
weeks of Easter.

THERE was still more riotous conduct during the evening ;
but when order was restored, Beaumont, by the request of
his new acquaintance, began to tell the story of his life after
he came to the United States .

"As soon as I got there," said he, " I took pains to become
naturalized.

For that purpose, I had to make friends with

some party.

What do you suppose it was ? Naturally, the

Abolitionists .

I wrote several articles for the Tribune about

the influence of slavery upon the whole state of society in
Russia. This, a new argument, was not a bad one, for the
Abolitionists to use against slavery in the Southern States ,
and I became a citizen of Massachusetts. Soon after my
arrival, I found a position in the office of one of the few

large firms belonging to that party in New York." Further,
he told them the same story which we already know. At
least, this part of Beaumont's biography cannot be doubted.
ΧΧΙ .

THAT very evening they made an agreement that the two
families should look for apartments which should be adjoin-

ing. In the expectation of finding and arranging suitable
apartments , the Beaumonts lived in the factory, where, according to the orders given by the firm, rooms for the manager were prepared. This temporary departure from the
city might be regarded as akin to the beautiful English custom of a wedding journey, which is now common all over
Europe.

When, in six weeks, two convenient adjoining flats were
found, the Kirsánofs suited in the one , the Beaumonts in the

other, the old Pólozof preferred to remain in his factory
apartment, the rooms of which reminded him, though to a

limited degree, of his former grandeur. It was also pleasant
for him to stay there because he was popular within a distance of three or four versts around.

There was no limit to

the signs of respect offered him by his own clerks and those
of the neighborhood, by the porters, and all the other suburban brethren of higher or lower dignity in this society
which gathered around the factory, and there was no measure to the pleasure with which the patriarch accepted these


======================================================================

446

A VITAL QUESTION.

signs of the general respect in which he was held as the most
important person of the district. His son-in-law came to the

factory every day ; and almost every day his daughter came
with her husband. In summer they moved down there
entirely , and lived in the factory, which took the place of a

datcha. The rest of the year, the old man, besides receiving
his daughter and son-in-law, who still was known as the
North American, often - every week, and oftener had the
pleasure of receiving guests, who came to spend an evening
with Katerina Vasilyevna and her husband. Sometimes only
the Kirsánofs and some young folks , sometimes the party
was larger. The factory served the general purpose of frequent out-of-town picnics for the circle in which the Kirsá-

nofs and Beaumonts lived. Pólozof was greatly delighted
at such invasion of guests, and how could he help it ? The
part of host belonged to him, and it was not deprived of its
patriarchal worshipfulness .

XXII .

THE two families each lived according to the style that
best pleased them. On ordinary days there was much noise
in one apartment, much quiet in the other. They met like
kinsfolks ; some days they met as often as ten times, and
each time for only a minute or two ; sometimes for a whole
day one of the apartments would be empty, and its inhabitants would be found in the other part. All this was according to circumstances. And when there were gatherings

of guests , it was again as it happened ; sometimes the doors
between the apartments would be locked, because the doors
which opened from the parlor of one apartment into the

reception-room of the other were generally locked ; but the

doors between the rooms occupied by Viéra Pavlovna and
Katerina Vasilyevna were constantly open. And so, sometimes the doors connecting the reception-rooms were locked ;
that was when the company was small. But if the party was

large, these doors were opened, and the guests would not
know whether they were at Viéra Pavlovna's or Katerina

Vasilyevna's ; and the khozydikas themselves could hardly
distinguish . The young people, when they wanted to take
a rest, generally found themselves in Katerina Vasilyevna's
rooms ; but when they did not come to rest, they would be


======================================================================

A VITAL QUESTION.

447

with Viéra Pavlovna. But the young people could not be
considered as guests , they are so intimate, and Viéra Pav-

lovna, without any ceremony, would drive them off to see
Katerina Vasilyevna .

" I am tired of you boys ! Go to Kátenka ; she never
gets tired of you. Why are you always quieter with her than
with me ? here I am older than she is ."

" Don't you trouble yourself ; we like her better than we
do you ."

Kátenka, why do they like you better than they do
me?"

" Because I scold them less than you do. "
" Da ! Katerina Vasilyevna treats us like men, and so we
behave like men when we are with her. "

Not bad was the effect of the game which was repeated

very often last winter in the home circle, when the young
folks and their intimate friends alone used to gather ; the
pianos from the two apartments were brought together ; the

young folks would cast lots, and divide into two choirs,
making their benefactresses sit one at the one , the other at the

other, grand piano, facing each other ; each choir would stand
near its prima donna, and at one and the same time they
would sing : Viéra Pavlovna with her choir, " La Donna é
Mobile" ; and Katerina Vasilyevna with her choir would
sing " Long cast off by Thee " ; or Viéra Pavlovna with
her choir would sing Lizette's Song from Béranger ; and
Katerina Vasilyevna, " Eramushkás' Song." This winter
something became popular : the former prima donnas, with
the aid of all, adapted to their own liking " the discussion of

two Grecian philosophers about the beautiful." It began
this way : Katerina Vasilyevna would lift her eyes to heaven,
and sighing languishingly, would say, " Divine Schiller, the
rapture of my soul ! " Viéra Pavlovna would answer with
dignity. " But the prunella shoes from Koralof's shop are
just beautiful ! " and she would thrust out her foot. Whoever of the young folks laugh at such a discussion would be
put into the corner; at the end of the discussion there would
remain two or three people out of ten or twelve, who were
not in the corner.

But an immeasurable excitement would

be aroused if they managed to inveigle Beaumont into this
game, and get him into the corner.

What else ? The sewing shops, continuing to agree, continued to exist.

Now there are three of them .

Katerina


======================================================================

448

A VITAL QUESTION.

Vasilyevna has arranged hers long ago. Now she very often
takes Viéra Pavlovna's place in the shop, and soon she will

have to take her place entirely. This year- forgive her she will pass her examinations as a doctor ; and then she
will have no time at all to occupy herself in the shop.
" It is a pity that there is no chance for these sewing

unions to develop as they might have been developed," says
Viéra Pavlovna sometimes. Katerina Vasilyevna does not
answer a word, only her eyes flash with indignation.
" What a quick temper you have, Kátya. You are worse
than I," says Viéra Pavlovna.

" It is good that your

father hasVib
something ; it is very good. "
" Yes , Viérotchka ; it is good. I have less anxiety for
my son." (You see, she has a son.)
" However, Kátya, I don't know what you make me think

of. We will always live quietly and peacefully, won't we ? "
Katerina Vasilyevna makes no reply.
" Yes , Kátya ; say yes for my sake."
Katerina Vasilyevna laughs .
" It does not depend on my yes or no ; and so for your
satisfaction, I will say yes, we will always live peacefully."
And indeed they all live peacefully. They live harmoniously and cordially and quietly and happily and gayly and
actively. But it does not follow from this that my story is

at end. All four of them are as yet young, active ; and if
their lives are arranged harmoniously and cordially, beautifully and solidly, still it has not ceased to be interesting : far
from it ; and I have a good many things yet to tell about
them ; and I vouch for it that the continuation of my story

about them will be much more interesting than what I have
related till now .
XXIII .

THEY live gayly and cordially ; they work and they rest ;
they enjoy life ; and look forward to the future if not without thought, yet with a firm and substantial assurance that
the further they go, the better it will be. Thus passed with
them the time of the third year and last year; and thus the
present year is passing, and the winter of the present year
is almost passed; the snow has begun to melt, and Viéra
Pavlovna inquired, " There will be one more frosty day yet,

won't there, so that we can have another winter picnic?"


======================================================================

A VITAL QUESTION.

449

And nobody could answer her ; but one day passes after
another, growing warmer and warmer, and every day the
probability of a winter picnic grew less. But lo ! at last,
when hope was lost, a snow-storm came such as we have in
midwinter, without warmth, but with a fine gentle frost : the
sky became bright. " It will be a splendid evening -picnic !
the picnic, - hurry up ; don't stop for the rest- a little one
without formality."
Two sleighs dashed away that evening. One was filled
with talk and jokes, but the other was really beyond con-

trol. As soon as they left town, they sang with all their
voices , and this was what they sang : " From the gate the maiden went,
From the gate of maple bent,
Hurried from the new-made gate,
With its new- made checkered grate.

' Angry is my bátiushka,
Has no mercy on his daughter ;
Will not let me wander late,

With the young lad gayly wait ;
Yet I do not heed my sire,

But will sport to heart's content. " 1

•

The idea of singing such a song ! Is that all ? Some of
the time they go slow and drop a quarter of a verst behind,
and then suddenly they catch up with the others, and race ;
they dash by with shouts and screams of laughter, and after
they have passed them, they fling snowballs at the gay but
not riotous sleigh. The more decorous sleighful, after two
or three such insults , determined to defend themselves .

They let the riotous sleigh get ahead of them, they collected
handfuls of new-fallen snow as secretly as possible, so that

the riotous sleigh might not discover them. When the
riotous sleigh slowed up again and fell behind, the decorous
sleigh was creeping along stealthily, and gave no sign that
they had procured weapons ; and when the riotous sleigh
bore down upon them again with shouts and shrieks, the
decorous sleigh offered most unexpectedly a brave defence.
But what does this mean ? The riotous sleigh turns out to

the right, even across gutters ; they don't care for anything ;
1 Literally: Forth went the young (girl) Out the new gate, Out the new, the
maple, Out the grated (gate) . " Own father is stern And unmerciful to me, Does

not let me divert myself With a bachelor fellow to sport. Idon't heed (my) father ;
I shall amuse the young (fellow) ."

they dash by a distance of a few rods.1 " Yes , she must
have suspected something ; she has taken the reins herself ;
she is standing up and driving," says the decorous sleigh.
" No, no, we'll catch up with them and pay them back."
It is a desperate race.

Will they overtake them or not?

" We shall," says the decorous sleigh with enthusiasm.
" No," it cries in despair ; then, with new enthusiasm
says , " Yes , we shall . "

" They are gaining on us," says the riotous sleigh in
despair. " They won't catch up with us,” it says in enthusiasm .

" Will they catch us or not ? "

In the decorous sleigh were seated the Kirsánofs and
Beaumonts ; in the riotous sleigh were four young men and

one lady, and it was she who was the ringleader in the
riotous sleigh .

" Your health, mesdames and messieurs. We are very
glad to see you again," she says from the platforin of the

factory stairs. — " Gentlemen, help the ladies out of the
sleighs , " she adds, addressing her companions .
Hurry up ! hurry up into the parlors ! The cold has
reddened all their cheeks .

" How do you do, you dear old man ? " 2
" He isn't an old man at all, Katerina Vasilyevna. What
made you tell me that he was old ? He will be flirting with
me next thing. Will you do it, you dear little old man ? "
asks the lady of the riotous sleigh.

" I will," says Pólozof, delighted because she gently
caressed bis gray whiskers .

" Children , will you let him flirt with me ? "
" Of course we will," says one of the young men.
" No, no ! " say the three others .
But why is the lady of the riotous sleigh dressed all in
black ? Is it mourning or caprice ?
" O dear me, I am tired ! " she said, throwing herself on
the Turkish divan which occupied the whole length of the
side of the parlor. "Children, more cushions ! Not for me
alone, but I think the other ladies are tired."

" Yes ; you have tired us all out ! " says Katerina Vasilyevna.

" The race with you over the rough road broke me all
up ! " says Viéra Pavlovna.

" It was a good thing that there was only one more visit

to the factory," added Katerina Vasilyevna.
They both settled themselves on the divan among the
cushions , in weariness .

" You weren't sharp enough ! you can't have had much
practice in racing. You ought to have stood up as I did ;
then the ups and downs amount to nothing. "

" Even we are rather tired." says Beaumont to Kirsánof.
They sat down by their wives. Kirsánof threw his arm
around Viéra Pavlovna.

Beaumont took Katerina Vasil-

yevna's hand. It was an idyllic picture. It is pleasant to
see happy unions. But a shadow crossed the face of the
lady in mourning for one moment, so that none except one
of her young companions noticed it. He went to the window
and began to study the arabesques made by the frost on the
glass .

" Mesdames , your stories are very interesting, but I can't
hear what you say ; all I know is that they are very pathetic

but that they end happily ; I like that ! But where is my
dear little old man ? "

" He is busy about the house ; he is getting lunch ready ;
this always amuses him," said Katerina Vasilyevna.

" Well, in that case, God be with him ! Tell me your

story, please , but briefly ; I like to be told things in few
words."

" I shall relate very briefly," says Viéra Pavlovna ; let me
begin. When it is the others' turn, let them tell theirs. But
I will tell ‫و‬you
beforehand that there are secrets at the end of
‫د‬
my story . "

" Well, then we'll drive out these gentlemen.

Or perhaps

it would be better to drive them out now ! "

" No ; now they can listen."
Viéra Pavlovna began her story.
*

" Ha ! ha ! ha !

This sweet Julie, I love her dearly ! "

and she throws herself down on her knees and she carries on

and behaves herself terribly.

She is lovely ! "

*

Bravo, Viéra Pavlovna ! " I am going to jump out of
the window ! Bravo, gentlemen ! " The lady in mourning

clapped her hands. At this command the young people

applauded deafeningly, with shouts of " hurrah ! " and
" bravo ! "

"What's got into you ? What's got into you? " said Katerina Vasilyevna, in affright two or three minutes later.
" No, it's nothing much ! it'll pass. Give me a glass of
water ! Don't bother yourself ; Mosolof is bringing me
some. Thank you , Mosolof ! " She took the water brought
her by her young companion who had been standing by the
window. " Do you see how I have taught him ? He knows
everything beforehand. Now I feel all well again. Go
ahead, please ; I'm listening ! "
" No, but I am tired," she said, five minutes later, calmly
getting up from the divan. “ I must have a nap for an hour
or so. You see I am going without any ceremony. Come,
Mosolof, let us find the dear little old man; he will give me
a place."

" Excuse me, why shouldn't I do it? " asked Katerina
Vasilyevna.
" Is it worth while to trouble you ? "
" Are you going to give us up entirely ? " asked one of the
young men, taking a tragical pose. " If we had foreseen it ,
we should have brought daggers with us .
nothing to stab ourselves with. "

But now we have

" When lunch is ready, we will take the forks for daggers !" shouted another, with the enthusiasm of unexpected
salvation .

" Oh, no, I do not want the hope of our fatherland should
be prematurely destroyed," said the lady in mourning, in the
same excess of enthusiasm . " Be consoled, my children !
- Mosolof, put the small cushion on the table."
Mosolof put the cushion on the table. The lady in mourning was standing by the table, in a graceful position, and
slowly dropped her hand to the cushion.
The young folks kissed her hand.
Katerina Vasilyevna went to find a room for the weary
guest.

" Poor girl ! " said the three young men, who had been
with her in the shop, with one accord, when she left the
parlor.

" She is a brave woman ! " said the three young men.


======================================================================

A VITAL QUESTION.

453

" I should say she was," said Mosolof, with a sense of
satisfaction ."

" Have you known her long ? "
" Three years . "

" Do you know her well ? "
" Yes . -Don't be disturbed," he added, addressing those
who were in the sleigh ; " it's only because she is tired. "
Viéra Pavlovna exchanged significant glances with her
husband and Beaumont, and shook her head.

" It's absurd to say she is tired," said Kirsánof.
" I assure you she is tired, that's all. She will fall asleep,
and it will all pass," repeated Mosolof, in a calm and indifferent tone ."

In ten minutes Katerina Vasilyevna came back.
" How is she ? " asked six voices.

Mosolof did not ask.

" She went to bed and shut her eyes, and now she must be
asleep."

" I told you so," said Mosolof ; " it's a mere trifle."
" Still, I am sorry for her," said Katerina Vasilyevna .
" We will watch her by turns : you and I, Viérotchka, and
Charlie and Sasha."

" Don't let this interfere with our fun," said Mosolof.
"We can dance, and shout, and sing ; she sleeps very
sound ."

If she sleeps , if it is a mere trifle, then what does it mean ?

The disturbing impression caused for quarter of an hour, by
the lady in mourning, vanished and was forgotten, - not
absolutely, but almost. The party, even in her absence,
little by little took the character of all the similar parties
which had been held during the winter, and it became gay.
Gay, but not without restraint. At least, the ladies half a

dozen times exchanged looks of serious solemnity. Twice
Viéra Pavlovna whispered stealthily, " Sasha, suppose something of this sort should happen to me ? "
Kirsánof, the first time, could not find an answer. But
the second time he succeeded. " No, Viéra, nothing of this
sort could happen to you. "

" Cannot ? Are you sure ? "
"Yes ."

And Katerina Vasilyevna twice whispered to her husband
stealthily, " Charlie, this could not happen to me, could
it?"


======================================================================

454

A VITAL QUESTION.

The first time Beaumont only smiled, not gayly and not
reassuringly ; the second time he also succeeded in saying,
" By all probability, it could not."
And these were only occasional echoes, and then only at
first. But for the most part the evening was spent gayly ;
in half an hour it was quite gay. They talked, played, sang.
" She is sound asleep," says Mosolof, and he takes the lead.

And really, it was impossible to disturb her. The room
where she was lying down was a long way from the parlor,
separated by three rooms, a corridor, and a flight of stairs ,
and then another room .

It was at the further side of the

apartment .

And so the evening was a great success. The young

folks, as usual, either joined the others, or were by themselves. Beaumont joined them a couple of times ; a couple
of times Viéra Pavlovna would draw him from them and their
serious conversation .

They talked a great deal; but there was, after all, very
little serious discussion .

All were sitting together.

" Well, what was the result ? Was it good or bad ? " asked
one of the young men, who had taken the tragical attitude.
" She is rather worse than better," said Viéra Pavlovna.

" What do you mean,Viérotchka?" asked Katerina Vasilyevna.

" At all events , it is unavoidable in life," said Beaumont.
" It is an inevitable fate," said Kirsánof, in affirmation .

" It is an excellently bad thing ; consequently, it is excellent, " said the one who asked.

The other three young fellows nodded their heads, and
said, " Bravo, Nikitin ! "
The young folks were by themselves .

" I did not know him, Nikitin ; but you knew him, didn't
you ? " asked Mosolof.
" I was a little boy then, but I saw him."
" But how does it seem to you now, as you look back ? do
they tell the truth ? Would he accept her friendship ?? "
" No."

" And haven't you seen him since ? "


======================================================================

455

A VITAL Question.

" No. However, Beaumont was at that time in America."
" Really ! Karl Yakovlich, come here just a moment.
Did you meet in America that Russian of whom we are
speaking ? "
" No."

" It should be time for him to come back ."
" Yes ."

" What an idea came into my head," said Nikitin ; " he
would make a nice match for her."

" Gentlemen, some of you come and sing with me," said
Viéra Pavlovna. - " So two of you want to come ? So much
the better ! "

Mosolof and Nikitin stayed behind.

" I can show you an interesting thing, Nikitin," said
Mosolof . - " What do you think - is she sleeping ? "
" No."

" Only don't tell ! You can tell her after you get better
acquainted with her ; but nobody else. She would not like it."
The windows of the apartment were low.

" This window, you see, is near the fire."

Mosolof

looked.

" That's it ; do you see?"
The lady in mourning had moved her chair to the table, and
was sitting down : with her left elbow she leaned on the

table, the palm of her hand supported her drooping head,
hiding her cheek and part of her hair. Her right hand was
resting on the table, and her fingers were drumming mechanically, as though she were playing some tune. The
lady's face had a fixed expression of melancholy, sorrowful
but still more stern. Her eyebrows were lifting and drooping, lifting, drooping .

" Is it always so, Mosolof ? "
" You see. However, let us come away, else we'll catch
cold. It's already quarter-past ten. "
" What a heartless fellow you are ! " said Nikitin, looking
keenly into his comrade's eyes as they passed by the lamp in
the entry.

" You are getting sentimental, little brother.

Is this your

experience ?"
Lunch was ready.

" What splendid vodka this is," said Nikitin ; " how strong
it is ! It takes away your breath."


======================================================================

456

A VITAL QUESTION.

" Ekh ! little winch ! your eyes are already red," said
Mosolof. All began to make fun of Nikitin in the same
way.

" It's only because it choked me, but I can generally
drink," said he, in justification. They began to look at
their watches . " It's only eleven o'clock ; we can count on
half an hour more ; we shall have time."

In half an hour Katerina Vasilyevna went to wake the
lady in mourning. She was met by her on the threshold,
stretching herself after her nap.
" Did you sleep well ? "
" Splendidly."

" And how do you feel ? "
" Magnificently. I told you it was a mere trifle ; I got
tired because I fooled too much.

Now I shall be more

staid ."

But, no, she could succeed in being staid. In five minutes
she was already charming Pólozof, and ordering round the
young men, and was drumming out a march, or something of
the sort, with the handles of two forks on the table.

Then

she was in a hurry to leave ; but the others, who had got into
a gale from her renewed riot, did not want to go.
" Are the horses ready ? " she asked, getting up from the
lunch table .

" Not yet. We have just sent to have them put in. "
" You good-for-nothings ! But if this is so, come, Viéra
Pavlovna, sing us something ; I have been told that you have
a splendid voice."
Viéra Pavlovna sang.

" I shall often ask you to sing," said the lady in mourning.
" Now it's your turn ! now it's your turn ! " they all cried.
But they had hardly time to urge her before she was seated
at the piano.

" Well, all right, only I can't sing ; but that makes no
difference. I don't care for anything. Now, mesdames
and messieurs, I am not going to sing for your sake, but for
my children . Children, don't you laugh at your ma ! " At
the same time she struck the chords which lead to the accom-

paniment. " Children, don't you dare to laugh, for I shall
sing with feeling." And, trying to bring out the notes
as squeaky as possible, she sang : "Moans the dark blue - "


======================================================================

A VITAL QUESTION.

457

The young people roared with laughter at such an unexpected method, and the rest of the company also laughed.
And the songstress herself could not refrain from joining ;
but, suppressing her merriment, she continued, twice as
squeaky as before :
" Moans the dark blue little pigeon,1
Moans all day and moans all night
For his sweetheart

"

But at this word her voice really trembled and choked.
" It doesn't go, and it's just as well that it doesn't go.
But if this doesn't go , something else will - something bet-

ter? Listen, children, to your mother's advice : Don't fall
in love, and know that you have no right to marry."
Then she sang in a strong, full contralto : " In our towns, a host of beauties are ;

In each twilight eye there shines a star.
Happy fate regards them all sincerely,
But

" This but is stupid , children, But the brave young fellow loves too dearly.

There's no sense in that,
why,

its perfect nonsense,

but you,

Do not wed her, gallant youth ;
Hear my warning words.2

" Still more nonsense, children, and maybe this is also
nonsense . You can fall in love, you can wed, but it must
be only through choice, and without deceiving yourselves ,
children. I am going to sing to you how I married. It is
an old romance, but I am also old.

I am sitting on the bal-

cony of our castle. Dalton, for I am Scotch ; I am beautiful
and pale.

Further down is the forest and the river Bringal.

To the balcony slowly, stealthily, comes my lover ; he is
poor, and I am rich ; I am the daughter of a baron and a
lord, but I love him dearly, and I am singing to him, How beauteous Bringal's rugged shore,
Its forests green and tall !

My love and I, we love it more 1 Golubótchek .

Woulds't thou be willing, maiden, tell,
To lose their rank and race?

Because I was high born.
But ere thou yieldest, weigh it well,
What fate thou hast to face !

O maiden, I was born for strife,
In forests dark I wend.'

" Absolutely true ; dark forests ; so he says, ' Don't go
with me .'

How terrible will be my life !
Because in the dark forests are wild beasts .
How pitiful my end !

" That is not true, children ; it will not be pitiful.

But

then, he and I have thought, and he has thought, and still I
answer as before : -

" I have had a perfectly lovely time with you ; and where
there is enjoyment, you must have something to drink.
Hey! my little ale-house maiden,

SCENES .

" LET us start," said the lady in mourning ; but now she
was no longer in mourning ; a bright pink dress, a pink
hat, a white mantilla, and a handsome bouquet. She was
not alone , but with Mosolof.

Mosolof and Nikitin were

sitting on the front seat of the carriage ; on the coachman's box was a third youth, and next the lady was a man
of thirty years. How old was the lady ? Was she only
twenty, as she said, and not twenty-five? but this is a
matter of conscience if she exaggerates.
" Yes, my dear, I have waited for this day more than
two years . When I first got acquainted with him (she indicated Nikitin with her eyes) , I only anticipated ; but I
cannot say that I expected it. It was only a hope ; but
soon came assurance ."

" Excuse me, excuse me," says the reader, and not alone
the sapient reader, but every reader, growing more and
more astonished as he thinks it over.

" For more than two

years since she got acquainted with Nikitin ! "
" Yes," I say.

" She got acquainted with Nikitin at the same time that
she got acquainted with the Kirsánofs and Beaumonts on

that sleighing picnic which took place at the end of this
winter ? "

" Absolutely true," I say.
" What does it all mean ? Do you tell about things
taking place in 1865 ? "
" Yes ."

" Is it possible? have mercy ! "
" Why is it impossible, when I know ? "
" That is enough ! Who will listen to you ? ”
" Doesn't it really please you ? "
